<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oneplus-pad-3-review-is-this-the-best-budget-productivity-tablet-in-2025">OnePlus Pad 3 Review: Is This the Best Budget Productivity Tablet in 2025?</h2>
<p>I bought the OnePlus Pad 3 (12GB RAM version) for 25,000 EGP (530$) because I needed a second device for work. Not a laptop replacement — just something I could use for SSH connections, coding in VS Code, taking notes, and managing projects without constantly reaching for my main machine.</p>
<p>I also wanted to separate my work life from everything else. A device I could leave on standby for days without worrying about battery. Something lightweight I could grab for reading or blogging after work hours. And honestly, I wasn’t about to sell my kidney for an iPad or spend Samsung flagship money.</p>
<p>The OnePlus Pad 3 packs the world’s fastest mobile CPU — the Snapdragon 8 Elite, 12GB RAM, a massive 12,140mAh battery, and a stunning 13.2-inch 3.4K 144Hz display in a 5.97mm ultra-slim metal body. On paper, it’s competitive with much more expensive tablets. But does it actually work for real productivity? That’s what this review is about.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-in-the-box-spoiler-not-much">What’s in the Box? (Spoiler: Not Much)</h2>
<p>Opening the OnePlus Pad 3 box, you get the tablet and a USB cable. That’s it.</p>
<p>No charger. No stylus. No keyboard. Just the device and a cable.</p>
<p>If you want to actually charge it at the blazing 80W SUPERVOOC speeds this tablet supports, you’ll need to buy OnePlus’s charger separately for around 1,500 EGP. The Stylo 2 stylus costs about 5,000 EGP, and the official Smart Keyboard runs between 6,000 to 10,000 EGP depending on where you buy it.</p>
<p>So while the tablet itself is 25,000 EGP (530$), the full setup can easily push you to 37,500-41,500 EGP.</p>
<p><strong>Keep that in mind when comparing prices to other tablets.</strong></p>

<section id="build-quality-weight-thermal-performance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="build-quality-weight-thermal-performance">Build Quality, Weight &amp; Thermal Performance</h2>
<p>The OnePlus Pad 3 is impossibly thin at just 5.97mm. It’s an all-metal unibody design that feels premium and solid. You can hold it with one hand for a while without your arm getting tired. Despite the massive 13.2-inch screen, it doesn’t feel like you’re carrying around a brick.</p>
<p>Build quality is excellent. The Storm Blue color looks sophisticated, and the materials feel genuinely premium, not plasticky at all.</p>
<p>One thing that really surprised me: the temperature. This tablet doesn’t get hot. Even when I’m running multiple apps, doing SSH work, or watching videos for hours, it stays cool. OnePlus engineered a vapor chamber cooling system with 34,857mm² of heat dissipation area — that’s 14% better than the OnePlus Pad 2. I’ve used other devices that turn into hand warmers after 30 minutes. This one? No issues at all.</p>
<p>Battery life is exceptional. With a 12,140mAh battery (the highest capacity in its class), I can leave it on standby for days and it barely drains. OnePlus claims up to 18 hours of video playback and up to 6 hours of AAA gaming. In real-world use for work — coding, browsing, note-taking — I’m easily getting through a full day. This is exactly what I wanted: a device I don’t have to babysit with a charger.</p>

<section id="display-13.2-inch-3.4k-144hz-for-coding-productivity" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="display-13.2-inch-3.4k-144hz-for-coding-productivity">Display: 13.2-inch 3.4K 144Hz for Coding &amp; Productivity</h2>
<p>The 13.2-inch screen is phenomenal for productivity work. The 3.4K resolution (315 PPI) with 12-bit color depth delivers razor-sharp text and incredibly lifelike colors. The 144Hz refresh rate makes everything feel buttery smooth — scrolling through code, switching between apps, or just browsing feels incredibly responsive.</p>
<p>For reading and coding, the text is crystal clear. I spend a lot of time in VS Code and Obsidian, and I haven’t had any eye strain issues. The screen size gives you enough room to actually work without feeling cramped. You can comfortably run multiple apps side by side.</p>
<p>The display supports Dolby Vision HDR and covers the DCI-P3 color gamut. Colors look natural and accurate. Not overly saturated or washed out. Videos and images look stunning.</p>
<p>Peak brightness hits 900 nits, which means indoor visibility is excellent. The brightness gets high enough for well-lit rooms without any problems. I haven’t tested it extensively outdoors in direct sunlight, but it should handle most conditions.</p>

<section id="battery-life-18-hours-video-all-day-work" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="battery-life-18-hours-video-all-day-work">Battery Life: 18 Hours Video, All-Day Work</h2>
<p>The 12,140mAh battery on this tablet is outstanding. It’s one of the best things about it.</p>
<p>I can leave it on standby for days without worrying. When I pick it up after not using it for a while, the battery is basically where I left it. This is perfect for my use case — I wanted a device I could grab whenever I need it without constantly checking if it needs charging.</p>
<p>For active use, it easily lasts a full work day. SSH sessions, VS Code, browsing, note-taking, watching videos — I’m getting through 8-10 hours of real work without needing to plug in. OnePlus claims up to 18 hours of video playback, and I believe it.</p>
<p>Charging is fast with the 80W SUPERVOOC charger (sold separately, unfortunately). It charges quickly enough that you can top up during a break and be good for hours.</p>

<section id="speakers-microphone-8-speaker-setup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="speakers-microphone-8-speaker-setup">Speakers &amp; Microphone: 8-Speaker Setup</h2>
<p>The audio system on the OnePlus Pad 3 is seriously impressive. It has 8 speakers — four bass units and four tweeters. The sound is clear, loud, and has actual depth. You get proper stereo separation and bass response that most tablets can’t match.</p>
<p>Watching videos or listening to music is genuinely enjoyable without headphones. The speakers get loud enough to fill a room without distorting.</p>
<p>The microphone quality is solid too. I’ve used it for calls and meetings, and people on the other end can hear me clearly. No complaints there.</p>
<p>One small thing I really appreciate: the alarm sound isn’t annoying. It actually wakes you up without making you want to throw the device across the room. Small detail, but it matters.</p>
</section>
<section id="camera-good-enough-for-video-calls" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="camera-good-enough-for-video-calls">Camera: Good Enough for Video Calls</h2>
<p>The camera is surprisingly nice. It’s sharp and takes clear photos. I wasn’t expecting much from a tablet camera, but this one actually delivers decent quality.</p>
<p>Realistically though, how often do you use a tablet camera? For video calls and scanning documents, it works perfectly fine. For taking actual photos, you’re probably better off using your phone just because it’s more convenient to carry around.</p>
<p>But if you do need to take a photo with the tablet, you won’t be disappointed. The quality is there.</p>
</section>
<section id="performance-snapdragon-8-elite-dominates" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="performance-snapdragon-8-elite-dominates">Performance: Snapdragon 8 Elite Dominates</h2>
<p>The OnePlus Pad 3 is ridiculously fast. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is the world’s fastest mobile CPU, and it shows. This chip delivers 45% faster CPU performance, 40% faster GPU performance, and 300% faster NPU performance compared to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. The AnTuTu benchmark score hits 2,947,633.</p>
<p>Opening apps is instant. Switching between multiple apps is seamless. Running VS Code over SSH, having Obsidian open with large notes, browsing with multiple tabs, playing videos in the background — it all just works without any lag whatsoever.</p>
<p>The response time is excellent. No stuttering, no waiting around for things to load. It feels snappy in a way that makes you forget you’re using a mid-range priced tablet.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, this thing competes with and often beats Apple’s M2 chip, getting close to M3 territory. And here’s the crazy part: it’s significantly cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+, but outperforms it in nearly every aspect.</p>
<p>For gaming, the upgraded Adreno GPU with advanced cooling keeps frame rates high and consistent even during extended sessions. I don’t game much, but the performance headroom is there.</p>
<p>For the price, the performance you get is honestly insane.</p>
</section>
<section id="oneplus-os-the-weakest-link" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oneplus-os-the-weakest-link">OnePlus OS: The Weakest Link</h2>
<p>This is where things get rough. The software is the weakest part of this tablet by far.</p>
<p>The UI feels unpolished. It’s similar to Realme’s interface, and honestly, it’s not great. OnePlus clearly didn’t put much effort into the software side. The built-in Notes app, for example, looks like something someone threw together in ChatGPT in 10 minutes. It’s that basic.</p>
<p>The system update experience was absolutely terrible. It’s the worst update process I’ve ever dealt with on a new device. Frustrating, slow, and poorly designed. This alone almost made me regret the purchase.</p>
<p>On the positive side: the Music app doesn’t have ads. That might sound like a low bar, but after dealing with Realme’s music app that forced you to watch ads just to play local music files, this is actually refreshing.</p>
<p>The software works, but it feels like OnePlus shipped this tablet with placeholder apps and never bothered to finish them. For a device with this kind of hardware, the software experience is disappointing.</p>
</section>
<section id="oneplus-ai-features-actually-useful" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oneplus-ai-features-actually-useful">OnePlus AI Features: Actually Useful</h2>
<p>OnePlus has packed some genuinely useful AI features into this tablet, and they’re actually practical for daily work.</p>
<p><strong>AI Notes</strong> is probably the most useful one for me. One tap gives you instant summaries of long notes, or it can transcribe voice recordings without all the “umms” and “ahhs.” You can also clean up text, format it, continue writing, or adjust the tone between formal and casual. This is helpful when I’m taking quick notes and need to turn them into something more polished.</p>
<p><strong>AI Voice Recorder</strong> works really well. It transcribes accurately and removes filler words automatically. Great for meetings or capturing ideas quickly.</p>
<p><strong>AI Search</strong> (previously called Intelligent Search) is smart about finding things across your device. You can ask naturally like “How much do I need to pay for video production?” and it searches through your files, notes, and settings. It understands context, which makes finding stuff much faster than traditional search.</p>
<p><strong>AI Translation</strong> is solid. It works on text, images, live conversations, and even screen content in real-time. If you deal with multiple languages or watch foreign content, this is genuinely useful.</p>
<p><strong>AI Summary</strong> gives you instant summaries of articles and websites with one tap. <strong>AI Writer</strong> helps polish your writing and change tone. <strong>AI Speak</strong> reads on-screen content aloud for multitasking.</p>
<p>The tablet also features <strong>Google Gemini</strong> built-in. You can access it via the dedicated AI button on the keyboard or by long-pressing the navigation bar. It’s helpful for brainstorming, writing, planning, and learning.</p>
<p>The <strong>AI photo features</strong> (Perfect Shot, Unblur, Reflection Eraser, AI Eraser) are nice to have but I don’t use them much since I’m not focused on photography.</p>
<p>Overall, the AI features are actually practical tools, not just marketing gimmicks. The Notes and Voice Recorder AI especially help with my workflow.</p>
</section>
<section id="keyboard-stylus-pro-grade-accessories" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="keyboard-stylus-pro-grade-accessories">Keyboard &amp; Stylus: Pro-Grade Accessories</h2>
<p>I tested the tablet with a Redragon Bluetooth keyboard, and it works better than I expected. No noticeable latency at all. Typing feels responsive and smooth.</p>
<p>The problem is that using a separate Bluetooth keyboard without a proper setup gets annoying. You need to keep the tablet at the right distance, make sure it’s standing correctly, and you’re stuck without a mouse nearby. It works, but it’s not comfortable for long sessions.</p>
<p><strong>OnePlus Smart Keyboard</strong> (6,000-10,000 EGP) The official keyboard has a 6-row layout with a dedicated function row. It’s detachable with Bluetooth connectivity (works up to 10 meters wirelessly), and features NFC tap for One-touch Transmission to quickly share files. That’s expensive — especially when you consider the tablet itself is 25,000 EGP.</p>
<p><strong>OnePlus Stylo 2</strong> (5,000 EGP) The stylus offers 16,000 levels of pressure sensitivity, ultra-low latency, and haptic feedback. It also doubles as a laser pointer with page turn functions for presentations.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to end up buying the official keyboard anyway. I’m curious about the layout and how the switches compare to the mechanical keyboards I’m used to. I don’t know if I’ll love it, but I need something more integrated for serious work.</p>
<p>The typing experience matters when you’re coding or writing for hours, so having a proper keyboard setup is worth the investment.</p>

<section id="my-workflow-how-i-use-it-as-a-programmer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="my-workflow-how-i-use-it-as-a-programmer">My Workflow: How I Use It as a Programmer</h2>
<p>This is why I bought the tablet in the first place — to create a separate workspace that doesn’t mix with my personal life.</p>
<p>I wanted a device I could pick up for specific work tasks without reaching for my main laptop every time. Something I could leave on standby for days and grab whenever I need it. The OnePlus Pad 3 does exactly that.</p>
<p>Here’s how I use it:</p>
<p><strong>Coding &amp; Development</strong> - VS Code for SSH connections to my servers and remote development - I can work on projects without being tied to my main machine - The large 13.2-inch screen lets me see more code at once</p>
<p><strong>Note-Taking &amp; Knowledge Management</strong> - Obsidian for my personal knowledge base and daily notes - OneNote for quick captures and shared notes - The AI Notes feature helps clean up and format my thoughts quickly</p>
<p><strong>Productivity &amp; Task Management</strong> - Super Productivity for tracking my daily tasks and time - Linear for project management - Ankicards for learning and spaced repetition - Zotero for research and reference management</p>
<p><strong>File Sync &amp; Transfer</strong> - Syncthing keeps my files synced across devices - LocalSend for quick file transfers between my laptop and tablet</p>
<p><strong>Content Creation</strong> - YouTube Studio and TikTok Studio for uploading shorts and managing content properly - Substack for writing and publishing - Infinite Painter for occasional creative work</p>
<p><strong>Browsing</strong> - Brave as my main browser</p>
<p><strong>Media Consumption</strong> - Reading articles and documentation offline - Watching videos — the 3.4K screen and 8-speaker system make this incredible</p>
<p><strong>Seamless Connectivity</strong> The OnePlus Pad 3 connects seamlessly with my OnePlus phone. I can use my phone’s 5G without setting up a hotspot, sync notifications and clipboard, and use App Relay to continue tasks between devices. It also supports remote connection to Mac via the O+ Connect app for drag-and-drop file transfers and native Mac gestures.</p>
<p>The separation is the key benefit. I can work on an open project daily through these apps, then close the tablet and leave work behind. It’s a mental boundary that helps me stay focused during work hours and actually relax after.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-downsides-what-oneplus-got-wrong" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-downsides-what-oneplus-got-wrong">The Downsides: What OnePlus Got Wrong</h2>
<p>No device is perfect, and the OnePlus Pad 3 has some real frustrations.</p>
<p><strong>No SIM Support</strong> This is probably my biggest disappointment. The tablet doesn’t support a SIM card at all. If you need cellular connectivity on the go, you’re out of luck. You’re stuck with WiFi only or tethering to your phone (though the OnePlus phone integration makes this easier).</p>
<p><strong>No Charger in the Box</strong> You get a USB cable and that’s it. Want to actually charge the device at the advertised 80W SUPERVOOC speeds? Pay another 1,500 EGP for the official charger. It feels cheap to leave this out of a 25,000 EGP device.</p>
<p><strong>Software Needs Serious Polish</strong> The UI is rough. Built-in apps feel half-finished. The Notes app is embarrassingly basic. OnePlus clearly focused on hardware and ignored the software experience.</p>
<p><strong>System Updates Are Terrible</strong> This was the worst part of setting up the device. The update process is painfully slow, poorly designed, and frustrating. It’s the kind of experience that makes you question your purchase decision.</p>
<p><strong>Expensive Accessories</strong> The Stylo 2 costs 5,000 EGP. The Smart Keyboard is 6,000-10,000 EGP. The charger is 1,500 EGP. By the time you have a complete setup, you’re approaching iPad pricing territory — but at least you’re getting better specs.</p>
</section>
<section id="oneplus-pad-3-total-cost-breakdown-egp" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oneplus-pad-3-total-cost-breakdown-egp">OnePlus Pad 3 Total Cost Breakdown (EGP)</h2>
<p>Here’s what you’re actually paying when you buy the OnePlus Pad 3 with all the accessories you’ll realistically need:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Item</th>
<th>Price (EGP)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>OnePlus Pad 3 (12GB RAM)</td>
<td>25,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>OnePlus Stylo 2</td>
<td>5,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>OnePlus Smart Keyboard</td>
<td>6,000 - 10,000</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>80W SUPERVOOC Charger</td>
<td>1,500</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Total</strong></td>
<td><strong>37,500 - 41,500</strong></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So while the tablet itself looks affordable at 25,000 EGP, the full setup pushes you into the 37,500-41,500 EGP range.</p>
<p>For context: that’s approaching the total cost of a basic iPad setup. The difference? You’re getting significantly better specs with the OnePlus — the world’s fastest mobile CPU, a larger and sharper 3.4K display, double the battery capacity, and 8 speakers.</p>
<p>Here’s the really funny part: the iPad Magic Keyboard alone costs about the same as the entire OnePlus Pad 3 tablet. You’re paying iPad Magic Keyboard prices for a whole tablet that outperforms the iPad it would plug into. Let that sink in.</p>
</section>
<section id="oneplus-pad-3-vs-ipad-vs-samsung-which-wins" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="oneplus-pad-3-vs-ipad-vs-samsung-which-wins">OnePlus Pad 3 vs iPad vs Samsung: Which Wins?</h2>
<p>Let’s talk about what you’re getting compared to the competition, because the numbers are honestly wild.</p>
<p><strong>vs iPad (Base Model)</strong> The base iPad with similar accessories ends up costing roughly the same as a fully kitted OnePlus Pad 3. But the OnePlus has objectively better specs: - Snapdragon 8 Elite beats Apple’s M2 chip in many benchmarks - 13.2-inch 3.4K display vs 10.9-inch 2360x1640 on iPad - 144Hz vs 60Hz refresh rate - 12,140mAh vs ~7,600mAh battery - 8 speakers vs 2 speakers - 80W charging vs 20W charging</p>
<p>And here’s the absurdity: Apple’s Magic Keyboard costs around 25,000 EGP on its own. That’s the same price as the entire OnePlus Pad 3. You’re paying for a keyboard what OnePlus charges for a whole flagship tablet. The value proposition is insane.</p>
<p><strong>vs Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE+</strong> The Samsung costs more than the OnePlus Pad 3, but the OnePlus beats it in nearly every aspect. Better processor (Snapdragon 8 Elite vs Exynos 1480), larger battery, faster charging, bigger display, and better value. The Samsung might have slightly more polished software, but you’re paying a premium for the brand name.</p>
<p><strong>The Real Winner</strong> For 25,000 EGP, you’re getting performance that beats Apple’s M2 and approaches M3 territory. You’re getting flagship specs at mid-range pricing. The only real compromise is the software experience, which is rough but workable.</p>
<p>If you can live with OnePlus OS and don’t need cellular connectivity, this tablet offers unbeatable value in 2025.</p>
</section>
<section id="who-should-buy-the-oneplus-pad-3" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="who-should-buy-the-oneplus-pad-3">Who Should Buy the OnePlus Pad 3?</h2>
<p><strong>You should buy the OnePlus Pad 3 if:</strong></p>
<p>✅ You’re a programmer or developer who needs a secondary device for SSH, coding, and productivity work</p>
<p>✅ You want to separate work from your main laptop without spending iPad money</p>
<p>✅ You’re a content creator on a budget who needs something for YouTube Studio, TikTok, or blogging</p>
<p>✅ You’re a student who needs a powerful tablet for note-taking, research, and media consumption</p>
<p>✅ You want flagship performance without paying flagship prices</p>
<p>✅ You primarily use WiFi and don’t need cellular connectivity (though OnePlus phone integration helps)</p>
<p>✅ You can tolerate rough software in exchange for excellent hardware</p>
<p>✅ You want the best display and audio experience on an Android tablet</p>
<p><strong>Don’t buy this if:</strong></p>
<p>❌ You need SIM/cellular support — this tablet doesn’t have it</p>
<p>❌ You’re deeply invested in the Apple ecosystem and need seamless integration</p>
<p>❌ You expect premium accessories to be included — they cost extra</p>
<p>❌ You can’t deal with frustrating system updates</p>
<p>❌ You need polished, refined software out of the box</p>
</section>
<section id="final-verdict-910" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-verdict-910">Final Verdict: 9/10</h2>
<p>The OnePlus Pad 3 is a fantastic tablet trapped in mediocre software.</p>
<p>The hardware is exceptional. The Snapdragon 8 Elite performance is incredible. The 13.2-inch 3.4K 144Hz display is stunning. The 12,140mAh battery life is outstanding. The 8-speaker audio system is phenomenal. The 5.97mm ultra-slim metal design is gorgeous. For 25,000 EGP, you’re getting specs that compete with devices costing twice as much.</p>
<p>But the software experience is frustrating. The system updates are terrible. The built-in apps feel unfinished. OnePlus clearly put all their effort into hardware and phoned it in on software.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: if you’re like me and you’re installing your own apps anyway — VS Code, Obsidian, Super Productivity, Brave — the stock software doesn’t matter as much. You’re building your own environment. The hardware gives you an exceptional foundation to work with.</p>
<p>Would I buy it again? Yes. Despite the software frustrations and the lack of SIM support, this tablet does exactly what I needed: a fast, lightweight, long-lasting secondary device for work that didn’t cost iPad money. The Snapdragon 8 Elite performance, massive battery, and beautiful display make it worth every compromise.</p>
<p>The OnePlus Pad 3 isn’t perfect, but it’s the best value Android tablet for productivity work in 2025. Just budget for the accessories and prepare yourself for a rough software experience.</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 9/10</strong> — Exceptional hardware held back by rough software, but still the best value in its class.</p>

<p>Hi, I’m Kareem, a college student working on machine learning and web technology projects. I previously reviewed the Huawei FreeBuds 5i after 2 months of daily use, and now I’ve been testing the new FreeBuds 7i for 20 days. I don’t own a Huawei phone - I use a Realme Android device and MSI Linux laptop - so this is an honest review from someone using these earbuds outside the Huawei ecosystem.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unboxing-and-first-impressions"><strong>Unboxing and First Impressions</strong></h2>
<p>The FreeBuds 7i comes in a neat package with the earbuds, charging case, four sizes of silicone ear tips (XS, S, M, L - one more than the 5i), a USB-C charging cable, and the usual documentation. The case is bigger than the 5i (57.8 x 57.8 x 27.8mm vs 61.8 x 48.2 x 26.9mm) and slightly heavier at 36.5g compared to 33.9g, but there’s a good reason: the battery capacity jumped from 410mAh to 510mAh.</p>
<p>Available in three Morandi colors - Pink, White, and Black - the design is understated and elegant, though I personally miss the Isle Blue option from the 5i.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="huawei-freebuds-7i-call-qauilty-and-microphone"><strong>Huawei Freebuds 7i call Qauilty and Microphone</strong></h2>
<p>This is where the FreeBuds 7i truly shines. I don’t use these for regular mobile calls yet, but I rely on them daily for video meetings with my project partners. On the very first day, my friends noticed the difference immediately!</p>
<p>One partner said: <em>“Your voice is now more clear, did you change anything?”</em></p>
<p>Another friend asked: “Do you have a mechanical keyboard?” The funny thing is, I’ve always had a mechanical keyboard, but with the 5i my voice wasn’t clear enough for them to hear the typing sounds in the background. With the 7i, my voice comes through crystal clear while they can now actually hear my keyboard clicks.</p>
<p>The secret? The FreeBuds 7i features a bone conduction microphone working alongside three traditional microphones, with AI call noise cancellation that can handle noisy environments up to 90 dB. This combination delivers significantly better voice clarity compared to the standard mics on the 5i.</p>
<p>For anyone who does frequent video calls, online meetings, or even streaming, this upgrade alone justifies the purchase.</p>

<section id="sound-quality-and-audio-performance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sound-quality-and-audio-performance"><strong>Sound Quality and Audio Performance</strong></h2>
<p>The FreeBuds 7i packs an 11mm quad-magnet dynamic driver (upgraded from the 5i’s 10mm dynamic driver) with a wide frequency response range of 20 Hz to 40 kHz.</p>
<p>In real-world listening, the sound quality is similar to the 5i - both deliver excellent audio for the price point.</p>
<p>Music sounds clear with good separation, bass is punchy without being overwhelming, and podcasts come through crisp and detailed. The 7i also features Dynamic EQ that adjusts based on what you’re listening to, plus you can customize sound with 10 EQ bands through the AI Life app.</p>
<p>If you’re upgrading purely for music audio quality, you won’t notice a dramatic difference. The real improvements are in other areas.</p>

<section id="huawei-7i-noise-cancellation-intelligent-dynamic-anc-4.0" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="huawei-7i-noise-cancellation-intelligent-dynamic-anc-4.0"><strong>huawei 7i Noise Cancellation: Intelligent Dynamic ANC 4.0</strong></h2>
<p>The noise cancelling performance is better by a good margin. Huawei’s new Intelligent Dynamic ANC 4.0 delivers an average noise cancellation depth of 28 dB with less than 0.5 second latency. In practical terms, this means faster adaptation to changing noise environments.</p>
<p>When I walk down the street at night, I don’t hear most of the ambient voices and traffic noise anymore. On the subway or bus, the engine noise is effectively blocked.</p>
<p>In cafés, the background chatter fades away, letting me focus on my work. Are you in complete silence? No - some sounds still get through, especially sudden loud noises. But the improvement over the 5i is noticeable and makes a real difference in noisy environments.</p>
<p><strong>warning: after a month the noise left bud creates a very noise sound when it’s in ultra mode or dynamic with hight noise it’s very annoying and give me headache i udpated the earbuds to the latest version but it didn’t fixed</strong></p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mode-switching-a-small-change-that-matters"><strong>Mode Switching: A Small Change That Matters</strong></h3>
<p>One of my biggest frustrations with the 5i was the mode cycle order: Awareness → Off → Noise Cancelling. Since I primarily use ANC mode, I had to cycle through two modes every time I put them on.</p>
<p>The 7i finally fixes this! The new order is: Noise Cancelling → Off → Awareness. This might seem like a minor detail, but when you use these earbuds multiple times a day, it’s a quality-of-life improvement I genuinely appreciate.</p>

<section id="multi-device-connection-and-bluetooth-performance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multi-device-connection-and-bluetooth-performance"><strong>Multi-Device Connection and Bluetooth Performance</strong></h3>
<p>The FreeBuds 7i runs on Bluetooth 5.4 (upgraded from 5.2 on the 5i) and supports simultaneous dual-device connection. It’s noticeably smarter at switching between my Linux laptop and Realme Android phone compared to the 5i.</p>
<p>The connection is stable, transitions are smooth, and it works seamlessly whether I’m using the Huawei AI Life app or not. This is impressive considering I don’t even own a Huawei phone. The improved Bluetooth version also means better range and more stable connectivity.</p>
<p>For the Linux users out there: yes, it connects via bluetoothctl, though you might need to restart Bluetooth occasionally for a clean connection - same as with the 5i.</p>

<section id="freebuds-5i-battery-performance" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="freebuds-5i-battery-performance"><strong>FreeBuds 5i Battery Performance:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Single charge with ANC ON: 6 hours</li>
<li>Single charge with ANC OFF: 7.5 hours</li>
<li>Total with case (ANC ON): 18.5 hours</li>
<li>Total with case (ANC OFF): 28 hours</li>
<li>Earbud charging time: 60 minutes</li>
<li>Case charging time: 110 minutes (wired USB-C)</li>
</ul>
<p>While the 5i offers slightly longer listening time on a single charge with ANC enabled (6h vs 5h), the 7i wins in total battery capacity and especially charging speed. Going from 110 minutes to 60 minutes for a full case charge is almost half the time! The earbuds also charge faster - 40 minutes vs 60 minutes.</p>
<p>The fast charging feature is genuinely useful: a quick 10-minute charge gives you 4 hours of playback when you’re in a hurry.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="design-build-quality-and-comfort"><strong>Design, Build Quality, and Comfort</strong></h2>
<p>I’ll be honest here: the FreeBuds 5i case was more elegant and modern looking with its wider, flatter profile. The 7i’s case is more square-shaped and less stylish. However, the earbuds themselves are well-designed.</p>
<p>Each earbud weighs just 5.4g (vs 4.9g on the 5i), which is barely noticeable. The 7i includes four ear tip sizes (XS, S, M, L) compared to three on the 5i (S, M, L), giving you better options for a secure, comfortable fit. Both models have IP54 rating, meaning they’re dust-tight and splash-resistant - perfect for workouts or light rain.</p>
<p>The sound when closing the case is satisfying - a solid, premium click that I genuinely enjoy.</p>

<section id="gesture-controls-and-smart-features" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gesture-controls-and-smart-features"><strong>Gesture Controls and Smart Features</strong></h2>
<p>The touch controls are intuitive and responsive: - <strong>Double-tap:</strong> Play/pause music, answer/end calls - <strong>Triple-tap:</strong> Skip to next track (new feature vs 5i) - <strong>Swipe up/down:</strong> Volume control - <strong>Touch-and-hold:</strong> Switch between ANC modes or reject calls</p>
<p>New features on the 7i include: - <strong>Nod to pick up:</strong> Answer calls by nodding your head (needs to be enabled) - <strong>Unlimited Spatial Audio:</strong> 360° sound with head-tracking - <strong>Audio Sharing:</strong> Connect two pairs of FreeBuds to one device</p>
<p>The spatial audio feature works across different apps and devices, creating an immersive listening experience for movies and gaming.</p>

<p>The FreeBuds 7i is packed with sensors: - Infrared sensor (for wear detection) - Hall sensor (for case open/close detection) - Touch sensor (for gesture controls) - Gyroscope (for head-tracking in spatial audio) - Accelerometer - Bone voice sensor (for call quality)</p>
<p>These work together to provide smart features like auto-pause when you remove an earbud, and the improved call quality I mentioned earlier.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="compatibility-works-beyond-huawei-ecosystem"><strong>Compatibility: Works Beyond Huawei Ecosystem</strong></h3>
<p>One question I see often: “Do these work with non-Huawei phones?” Yes, absolutely! I’ve been using them with: - Realme Android phone (works perfectly) - MSI Linux laptop (connects via bluetoothctl) - Huawei Mate Pad 11 tablet (seamless integration)</p>
<p>The AI Life app (available for both iOS and Android) unlocks additional features like EQ customization, firmware updates, and gesture configuration. But even without the app, the core functionality works great on any Bluetooth device.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="final-verdict-is-the-freebuds-7i-worth-it"><strong>Final Verdict: Is the FreeBuds 7i Worth It?</strong></h2>
<p>After 20 days of daily use, the Huawei FreeBuds 7i is a meaningful upgrade over the 5i. The microphone quality improvement is immediately noticeable - my colleagues commented on it the first day. The Intelligent Dynamic ANC 4.0 delivers genuinely better noise cancellation, and the faster charging is a game-changer (60 minutes vs 110 minutes for the case).</p>
<p>Yes, the case design is less elegant than the 5i, but the functional improvements more than compensate. For anyone who relies on earbuds for productivity - video calls, meetings, focused work in noisy environments - the FreeBuds 7i is the clear winner.</p>
<p>The sound quality remains excellent, the battery life is better overall, the device switching is smarter, and features like spatial audio and nod-to-answer add genuine value. At around $100, these are among the best budget noise-cancelling earbuds available, even for non-Huawei phone owners.</p>
<p><strong>Rating: 4.5/5</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> - Excellent call quality with bone conduction mic - Better ANC performance (28dB depth) - Much faster charging (60min vs 110min for case) - Smarter multi-device switching - Spatial audio with head-tracking - 4 ear tip sizes for better fit - Works great outside Huawei ecosystem</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong> - Case design less elegant than 5i - Slightly heavier earbuds (5.4g vs 4.9g) - Single-charge battery with ANC slightly shorter (5h vs 6h) - No Isle Blue color option</p>
<p>If you do video calls or need excellent ANC, the FreeBuds 7i is worth every penny. If you only listen to music casually, the 5i is still a great choice.</p>

<p>It’s Friday and I have some time to continue working on open source tasks. I had an idea that requires translating a dataset. It’s not large - 2GB - and consists of some paragraphs from English. The average number of words is around 400 tokens per row from the 8 million rows :)</p>
<p>I looked into the OpenAI models to calculate how much this would cost me to translate all these with GPT-4.1 and GPT-4.1-mini, and the prices are the following: my total tokens =&gt; 8,000,000 rows * 400 tokens = 3,200,000,000. For the following calculations, I will assume input and output tokens are the same for ease of calculation. I will use the normal API, not the Batched API:</p>
<ul>
<li>total input tokens =&gt; 3,200,000,000</li>
<li>total output tokens =&gt; 3,200,000,000</li>

<p>I tested it with my local laptop GPU 1660Ti GTX mobile version with 6GB and CPU is Core i7 gen9 from Intel with 32GB DDR4. I tested the model and it worked with PyTorch very fast and very efficiently! The translations are very similar and this is enough for the task I want to build on this translated dataset!

<p>It’s a new feature in <a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/pytorch-2-x/">PyTorch 2</a> to accelerate the model speeds. I tried multiple settings and also the different backends but there is no huge difference. Convert to ONNX? It’s a nightmare. I did it before and the results didn’t worth the headache! I may try it when I have time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-do-quantization">Let’s Do Quantization</h2>
<p>I tried to use the <a href="https://docs.pytorch.org/ao/stable/serving.html">torchao</a> which enables performing quantization in more stable and easier ways. I tried it a lot with my GPU but due to CUDA version it always throws this error:</p>

<p>The library code is not straightforward and I don’t have time - I have just 2 days to finish this before I return to my main work.</p>
<p>I also faced some errors because the model I am trying to use is an old and not optimized one for these methods. It’s based on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-ar">OPUS-MT-en-ar</a> created with <a href="https://marian-nmt.github.io/">marianNMT</a> which is an efficient NMT implementation written in pure C++. The models have been converted to PyTorch using the Transformers library by Hugging Face</p>

<p>I searched for SGLang solution with the model and I didn’t find any help. I tried the vLLM documentation also and found the following pages: <a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/contributing/model/basic.html#1-bring-your-model-code">bring_your_own_model</a> and <a href="https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/models/supported_models.html#modelscope">this</a>. The model speed was worse than normal HF tensors - it was 5 seconds more. I think there is a better way to write the vLLM version better than mine.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="more-search-and-ctranslate-magic">More search and Ctranslate magic 🎩</h2>
<p>I wanted to give up, but let’s try a final search on how to serve Marian model. In an old forum answer I found what is called <a href="https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quickstart.html">CTranslate2</a>. They say it’s faster than HF Transformers for specific architectures by around 4-6x.</p>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> CTranslate2 is a C++ and Python library for efficient inference with Transformer models. The following model types are currently supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>Encoder-decoder models: Transformer base/big, M2M-100, NLLB, BART, mBART, Pegasus, T5, Whisper</li>
<li>Decoder-only models: GPT-2, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, OPT, BLOOM, MPT, Llama, Mistral, Gemma, CodeGen, GPTBigCode, Falcon, Qwen2</li>
<li>Encoder-only models: BERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa</li>
</ul>
<p>Compatible models should be first converted into an optimized model format. The library includes converters for multiple frameworks:</p>

<section id="key-features-of-ctranslate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-features-of-ctranslate">Key features of Ctranslate</h3>
<p><strong>Fast and efficient execution on CPU and GPU</strong><br>
The execution&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2#benchmarks">is significantly faster and requires less resources</a>&nbsp;than general-purpose deep learning frameworks on supported models and tasks thanks to many advanced optimizations: layer fusion, padding removal, batch reordering, in-place operations, caching mechanism, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quantization and reduced precision</strong><br>
The model serialization and computation support weights with&nbsp;<a href="https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/quantization.html">reduced precision</a>: 16-bit floating points (FP16), 16-bit brain floating points (BF16), 16-bit integers (INT16), 8-bit integers (INT8) and AWQ quantization (INT4).</li>
<li><strong>Multiple CPU architectures support</strong><br>
The project supports x86-64 and AArch64/ARM64 processors and integrates multiple backends that are optimized for these platforms:&nbsp;<a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onemkl.html">Intel MKL</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN">oneDNN</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.openblas.net/">OpenBLAS</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/google/ruy">Ruy</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accelerate">Apple Accelerate</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic CPU detection and code dispatch</strong><br>
One binary can include multiple backends (e.g.&nbsp;Intel MKL and oneDNN) and instruction set architectures (e.g.&nbsp;AVX, AVX2) that are automatically selected at runtime based on the CPU information.</li>
<li><strong>Parallel and asynchronous execution</strong><br>
Multiple batches can be processed in parallel and asynchronously using multiple GPUs or CPU cores.</li>
<li><strong>Dynamic memory usage</strong><br>
The memory usage changes dynamically depending on the request size while still meeting performance requirements thanks to caching allocators on both CPU and GPU.</li>
<li><strong>Lightweight on disk</strong><br>
Quantization can make the models 4 times smaller on disk with minimal accuracy loss.</li>
<li><strong>Simple integration</strong><br>
The project has few dependencies and exposes simple APIs in&nbsp;<a href="https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/python/overview.html">Python</a>&nbsp;and C++ to cover most integration needs.</li>
<li><strong>Configurable and interactive decoding</strong><br>
<a href="https://opennmt.net/CTranslate2/decoding.html">Advanced decoding features</a>&nbsp;allow autocompleting a partial sequence and returning alternatives at a specific location in the sequence.</li>
<li><strong>Support tensor parallelism for distributed inference</strong><br>
Very large model can be split into multiple GPUs. Following this&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2/blob/master/docs/parallel.md#model-and-tensor-parallelism">documentation</a>&nbsp;to set up the required environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these features are difficult to achieve with standard deep learning frameworks and are the motivation for this project.</p>

<section id="lets-try-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lets-try-it">Let’s try it!</h3>
<p>I used the following script to convert the HF version into CTranslate2 expected format:</p>

  <title>Getting Back to RSS</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>Hi!<br>
These are my thoughts on digital minimalism and staying ahead in AI without burning out.</p>
<section id="the-flood-of-information" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-flood-of-information">The Flood of Information</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/yang991178/fluent-reader">Fluent Reader</a> to keep track of the feeds I love, covering topics like machine learning (ML), life, and more.<br>
<img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/life_style/images/vision_read.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Fluent Reader"></p>
<p>Yesterday, I read an article from <a href="https://www.answer.ai/posts/2025-06-05-readbench.html">Answerdotai</a> about Vision Language Models (VLMs).</p>
<p>I spent about 15 minutes diving into the ideas and reflecting on how they relate to my recent projects using Colpali and DSE.</p>
<p>Today, I opened X.com and saw a thread by Benjamin about the same article.</p>
<p>I skimmed it but couldn’t recall anything meaningful! There was no real engagement—just a fleeting sense of encountering new VLM updates.</p>
<p>I bookmarked the post, thinking I’d revisit it for my next project or research idea that could “change my life.” Spoiler: I probably won’t.</p>
</section>
<section id="is-twitter-the-best-for-ml-maybe" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="is-twitter-the-best-for-ml-maybe">Is Twitter the Best for ML? Maybe!</h2>
<p>My Twitter feed is highly customized, and I use an extension to block distractions.</p>
<p>Yet, every time I open it, I’m flooded with ideas and AI updates that feel overwhelming.</p>
<p>It’s one reason I struggle to finish projects. While X is great for staying updated and connecting with top minds in the field, it’s not the only way.</p>
<p>You can mention people like Jeremy Howard, Tom Arson, or the Hugging Face team and often get a response within an hour—pretty cool!</p>
<p>I deleted my Twitter account last year but created a new one, hoping to earn from the ad system and share my projects.</p>
<p>However, I haven’t completed a single project I’m proud to share. Everything’s still in the early stages.</p>
<p>I don’t need X! These feel like flimsy reasons to stay active there. There’s a way to get the benefits without harming my focus, health, or life.</p>
</section>
<section id="personal-branding-and-linkedin" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-branding-and-linkedin">Personal Branding and LinkedIn</h2>
<p>What is LinkedIn? It’s supposed to be your portfolio for job opportunities and personal branding. I’ve tried perfecting my profile, applying for jobs, and sharing work, but I’ve had no offers through LinkedIn. This week, I landed two jobs—one through a friend’s referral and another via open-source connections—without LinkedIn’s help.</p>
<p>To me, LinkedIn feels fake. The algorithms are broken, and it’s become a waste of time. If you want to learn about me, check my CV and website at kareemai.com.</p>
<p>By focusing on deep, unique work, I believe I can create my own gravity to attract better opportunities aligned with my interests. Will this work for everyone? Probably not. These are just my thoughts and experiences.</p>
<p>By the way, a Hugging Face profile might be better for landing AI jobs if you’re creating real, impactful work.</p>
</section>
<section id="make-it-hard-for-people-to-reach-you" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="make-it-hard-for-people-to-reach-you">Make It Hard for People to Reach You</h2>
<p>Am I going to live in a cave? No! In a recent meeting, a friend jokingly called me “our search engine.”</p>
<p>I want to stay connected to what matters and gain maximum benefits without fracturing my attention with short posts or inauthentic interactions.</p>
<p>There’s freedom in posting something without expecting comments or reactions. If you like it, great! If not, that’s fine too. Why didn’t you like it? Maybe it’s beginner-level or poorly written. I’ll do better next time.</p>
<p>I’ve set boundaries to manage interactions:</p>
<pre><code>Don’t send me voice notes—write instead. It’s quicker, and I don’t have to pause everything to listen.
Don’t call me—send a message first.
Don’t leave comments—email me instead.</code></pre>
<p>Tough? Sure. Some people might not like it, but it filters out noise and preserves what’s important. People may get annoyed initially, but they adapt quickly.</p>
</section>
<section id="back-to-rss-discord" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="back-to-rss-discord">Back to RSS + Discord</h2>
<p>After five years, I’ve identified the sources I value and noticed a pattern. Why not collect them in one managed place, free from algorithms and ads? That’s where RSS comes in. I love it—it’s a superpower! When I first learned about RSS in college, I pictured an old Englishman in a garden reading about obscure topics. Now, I’ve become that “old man” who craves calm, minimal, and boring tools.</p>
<p>You can even follow YouTube channels via RSS without opening a browser! <img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/life_style/images/fluent_reader.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Fluent Reader"></p>
<p>For interacting with people, Discord channels are better. I can still reach folks like Jeremy and Tom there.</p>
</section>
<section id="next-ideas" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-ideas">Next Ideas</h2>
<p>I have many changes I want to implement and thoughts to refine. I’m working on improving:</p>
<pre><code>Activity Watch
Todo Manager
Thoughts Logging
Media Manager</code></pre>
<p>I’m also focusing on better habits like sleeping, eating, and walking.</p>

<section id="arabic-embedding-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arabic-embedding-models">Arabic Embedding Models</h2>
<p>This blog post introduces the <strong>Bojji and Zarra</strong> family of static embedding models, designed for Arabic language tasks and built using the <strong>model2vec</strong> distillation technique from MinishLab.</p>
<p>These models distill knowledge from larger transformer models, such as SBERT, into compact, efficient embeddings.</p>
<p>This approach balances performance with speed and resource efficiency.</p>
<p>Below, I explore the Bojji models and their relationship to <strong>Potion</strong> models, their strengths and limitations, and their applications in Arabic embedding tasks.</p>
<section id="what-are-potion-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-are-potion-models">What are Potion Models?</h3>
<p><strong>Potion models</strong> combine innovative techniques to create high-performing, compact static embeddings.</p>
<p>I liken them to Bojji from <em>Ousama Ranking</em> small in size but capable of competing with giants like Jina AI and BGE models.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-the-model2vec-distillation-method">What is the model2vec Distillation Method?</h3>
<p>The <strong>model2vec</strong> distillation method addresses the challenge of creating fast, compact sentence transformers.</p>
<p>It transforms large sentence transformer models into static embeddings that are up to <strong>500x faster</strong> and <strong>15x smaller</strong>, with only a minor performance trade-off.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional methods like GloVe, model2vec captures knowledge from large sentence transformers, producing uncontextualized word vectors.</p>
<p>While this sacrifices some contextual nuance, it offers significant advantages in:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Speed</strong>: Up to 500x faster inference.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Size</strong>: Models reduced by up to 50x, ranging from 8 MB to 30 MB.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Versatility</strong>: Sufficient word representations for most NLP applications.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="jina-embeddings-v3-for-arabic">Jina Embeddings v3 for Arabic</h2>
<p>The <strong>jina-embeddings-v3</strong> model is currently the top-performing open-source, zero-shot embedding model for Arabic on the MTEB leaderboard.</p>
<p>It excels across various tasks and has been validated in production for Arabic applications.</p>
<p>However, its large size and high memory requirements make it computationally expensive and slow compared to other embedding models.</p>
<p>To address this, I used model2vec to create a compact Arabic version, the <strong>Zarra</strong> and <strong>bojji</strong> with with another base model and different method, which retains strong performance while being significantly smaller and faster.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://huggingface.co/NAMAA-Space/zarra">Zarra HuggingFace</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Zarra</strong> models are the first static embedding models for Arabic trained with <strong>tokenlearn</strong> on the Arabic subset of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/c4">C4 dataset</a>.</p>
<p>They are optimized for Arabic-specific tasks and come in multiple sizes:</p>
<p>All variants support <strong>float32</strong> and <strong>int8</strong> quantization without performance loss, making them highly efficient for resource-constrained environments.</p>

<p>I filtered the most related MTEB tasks that supports Arabic-script only the evalution script is in the references blow. We can say that the average score for the Zarra are very low compared to the other models, but didn’t let the Average score fool you! Average is affected with the outliers so, if one task is the low the final answer with be low also.</p>
<p>But from the first look, we can see the peformance is similar to the Arabic versions of MiniLM-L12 in Average and if you looked at the Sentence similarity for STS22 it’s score are very good compared to static-embedding model.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="understanding-mteb-tasks-for-arabic">Understanding MTEB Tasks for Arabic</h3>
<p>The Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) evaluates embedding models across various tasks. Here’s a breakdown of the tasks used :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>MIRACLRetrievalHardNegatives: Measures retrieval accuracy for hard negative examples, critical for search and question-answering systems. Zarra’s lower score here reflects its static embedding nature, which sacrifices some contextual nuance.</p></li>
<li><p>MLQARetrieval: Tests retrieval performance on multilingual question-answering datasets, where Zarra performs comparably to MiniLM models.</p></li>
<li><p>STS17 &amp; STS22: Evaluates semantic textual similarity, where Zarra excels, particularly in STS22, with scores rivaling larger models.</p></li>
<li><p>XNLI: Assesses natural language inference, where Zarra’s performance is competitive despite its compact size.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks highlight Zarra’s strengths in semantic similarity and efficiency, making it ideal for applications like chatbots and lightweight search systems</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="bojji-vs.-all-minilm">Bojji vs.&nbsp;all-MiniLM</h3>
<p>The Bojji model outperform the <strong>all-MiniLM</strong> family from SBERT in Arabic tasks while being significantly faster and capable of running on CPU.</p>
<p>This makes Bojji an excellent lightweight alternative for applications requiring efficient Arabic embeddings.</p>
<p>Also the models performance is most of the time better than the <strong>potion-multilingual-128M</strong> which indicates that techniques are working with any language not just English.</p>

<section id="arabic-rag-leaderboard" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arabic-rag-leaderboard">Arabic RAG Leaderboard</h3>
<p>To complement MTEB evaluations, I tested Zarra on the <strong>Arabic-RAG Leaderboard</strong>, which provides a robust benchmark for Arabic-specific tasks. Zarra ranks 37 out of 45 models with an average score of <strong>36.84</strong>.</p>
<p>This is impressive, as Zarra is the smallest model in the leaderboard, highlighting its efficiency and competitive performance in resource-constrained settings.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-about-bojji-perfomrance-in-arabic-rag-leaderboard">What about Bojji perfomrance in Arabic RAG Leaderboard?</h4>
<p>Actually the first model with Zarra and not bojji is the second release of Zarra with different updates but..i know that if i didn’t write the blog as it as, i will not publish it again!</p>
<p>Bojji will be test on the Arabic Rag soon.</p>

<p>It’s very clear the main advantage of the static embedding models here:</p>
<p>They can process large number of samples on cpu which make them very useful for : 1. Clustring 2. Build classification pipelines on top of them 3. Use them in edge-devices 4. base models for chunking algorithms and dudplications..more to come soon ! ❤️</p>

<p>In the fast-paced tech world of 2025, cloud GPUs drive AI breakthroughs, machine learning, and high-performance computing (HPC). Whether you’re training large language models (LLMs) or tackling vision tasks, finding the <strong>best cloud GPU providers</strong> at the right price is critical. With varied pricing from platforms like CoreWeave and Hyperstack, the landscape can feel overwhelming. That’s where <strong>GPUvec</strong> shines—your go-to hub for <strong>cloud GPU pricing comparison</strong>, <strong>GPU benchmarks</strong>, and tools like our <strong>model size calculator</strong>.</p>
<section id="why-cloud-gpu-pricing-matters" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-cloud-gpu-pricing-matters">Why Cloud GPU Pricing Matters</h3>
<p><strong>Cloud GPU pricing</strong> can define your project’s success. From startups to enterprises, demand for scalable, cost-effective GPUs is surging. Providers like Hyperstack offer NVIDIA H100s at $1.90/hr, while others compete with flexible rates for AI workloads.

<section id="why-tarteel-not-fang" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-tarteel-not-fang">Why Tarteel, Not FANG?</h2>
<ul>
<li>As a Muslim, my ultimate goal isn’t just to accumulate wealth or knowledge for their own sake. I’m guided by broader concepts like taqwa (God-consciousness), righteous deeds, and sincere intentions. With only one short life to live, I want to make the most of it in the best way possible.</li>
<li>Working at big tech companies as a programmer offers good financial rewards and significant technical growth, along with practical experience—though it comes with its fair share of challenges. However, it also means operating under the umbrella of foreign companies with their own agendas and ideologies. Take the major players like Google, Facebook, X, and Amazon, for example.</li>
<li>Their leaders, in one way or another, have supported the occupation of Gaza, contributed to the suffering of children, and restricted our freedom of expression.</li>
<li>Our accounts get banned, our voices silenced, and these companies provide both material and moral support to oppressive entities with every means at their disposal.</li>
<li>I’m not denying that working for such companies might be permissible under certain Islamic legal perspectives, but personally, I have no desire to be part of them. So, where do I want to go instead? Do I even have rules? After all, I haven’t worked at a “real” company yet—only freelance gigs and open-source projects.</li>
<li>The truth is, I do have specific criteria for the kind of work environment I want to invest my time in. Here’s what I’m looking for:
<ul>
<li>A workplace that respects my faith, including what’s halal and haram, and honors religious practices.</li>
<li>A team working on meaningful projects with real humanitarian impact—projects that benefit society without involving anything forbidden, even if they’re not explicitly religious.</li>
<li>A place that fosters my growth beyond just financial gain. As someone passionate about data science, I want to join a team grounded in strong scientific principles, up-to-date with advancements, and focused on innovation—not blind imitation or merely using what’s available.</li>
<li>A supportive, ambitious team led by kind and fair management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>That’s when my eyes turned to Tarteel. I first came across it during high school, watching episodes featuring <a href="{{video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=100Qq-mLDbMo}}>">Hazem Al-Siddiq and Abdul Latif</a> discussing the idea behind Tarteel and its early beginnings. Even now, after graduating, I’ve kept up with the company’s progress.</li>
<li>From what I can see, it embodies everything I’m looking for—at least on the surface—and I assume the best of the people working there. My dream for the next two years is to join the Tarteel team.</li>
</ul>

<section id="tarteels-vision" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tarteels-vision">Tarteel’s Vision</h2>
<p>Tarteel AI is the world’s leading app for Quran memorization and recitation. It’s a tool that supports millions of Muslims globally by providing features to help them memorize and connect with the Quran. When you read their application page, it’s genuinely inspiring:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fully remote work—work anytime, anywhere.</li>
<li>A balance of dunya and akhira—an Islamic workweek, Islamic holidays, and a culture rooted in faith.</li>
<li>Unlimited time off (with manager approval).</li>
<li>Yearly team retreats and off-sites.</li>
<li>The freedom to work in your thobe, abaya, or traditional clothing from the comfort of home.</li>
<li>A chance to be part of a company leading AI and technology innovation in the Muslim community.</li>
<li>An opportunity to contribute to impactful projects that benefit Muslims worldwide.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machine-learning-engineer-at-tarteel">Machine Learning Engineer at Tarteel</h2>
<p>Tarteel is always seeking talented individuals passionate about advancing the state of the Muslim ummah through their unique skills. They encourage applicants to share as much as possible about their interests and abilities.</p>
<p>So, here’s my story: I’ve applied to Tarteel 4 times!</p>
<ul>
<li>The first time was during my second year of college, seeking an internship. My skills were basic—I had just started learning about deep learning—but the advice they gave me was encouraging and kind.</li>
<li>After graduation, I applied again but was rejected without explanation. I assume it’s because I was a fresh graduate, and they likely needed someone with experience in large-scale projects. That’s fair.</li>
<li>Seven months later, just before Ramadan 2026, Tarteel announced internship opportunities for the first time. I applied but wasn’t accepted. The competition was tough, and I don’t think I was the strongest candidate at the time—no hard feelings!</li>
<li>What now? I’m determined to prove I have the knowledge and skills to contribute. Here’s what I’m currently working on:
<ul>
<li>Arabic NLP, LLMs, and speech recognition with the Namma community, where I’m contributing to open-source projects and research papers.</li>
<li>A remote research lab in Russia, which is accelerating my technical growth.</li>
<li>Plans to join a company to learn about cloud deployment, model optimization, and GPU workloads.</li>
<li>Studying Quranic sciences and Tajweed to deepen my connection to the field.</li>
<li>Building small projects inspired by Tarteel’s vision to test my abilities and see where they take me.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><h1 id="لماذا-نمد-أيدينا-بشكل-غريزي-إلى-هواتفنا-خلال-لحظات-الملل-أو-الفراغ">لماذا نمد أيدينا بشكل غريزي إلى هواتفنا خلال لحظات الملل أو الفراغ؟</h1>
<p>ليس من قبيل الصدفة. تم تصميم التطبيقات لجذبنا مرة أخرى، والحفاظ على انتباهنا وتقديم دفعات من الدوبامين أثناء استخدامها.</p>
<p>ومع ذلك، فإن مجرد معرفة ذلك لا يمنعنا من تشتيت انتباهنا.</p>
<p>في هذه المقالة، سأشارك العديد من التطبيقات المفيدة والنصائح العملية للتخلص من هذه المشكلة أو تقليل خطرها بقدر الإمكان:</p></li>
<li><h2 id="أوقف-تشغيل-الإشعارات" class="anchored">1. أوقف تشغيل الإشعارات</h2>
<ul>
<li>الإشعارات هي بوابة المشتتات.</li>
<li>معظم الإشعارات غير مهمة ولكنها تخلق شعورًا زائفًا بالإلحاح.</li>
<li>بدلاً من مراجعة إشعارات كل تطبيق على حدة، من الأسهل تبني عقلية أن جميع الإشعارات يجب أن تكون متوقفة بشكل افتراضي.</li>
<li>أوقف تشغيل كل شيء أولاً، ثم قم بتمكين الإشعارات فقط للتطبيقات الأساسية مثل المراسلة والتقويم.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2 id="استخدم-أيقونات-سوداء-ومصغرة" class="anchored">2. استخدم أيقونات سوداء ومصغرة</h2>
<ul>
<li>تأتي كافة الواجهات بأيقونات كبيرة وملونة، يمكنك معرفة التطبيق بمجرد اللون فقط، فاللون الأصفر هو تطبيق سناب شات واللون البنفسجي هو الإنستجرام.</li>
<li>يمكنك فتح متجر الثيمات الخاص بجهازك الشخصي وتغيير الأيقونات للون ثابت وموحد، يفضل أسود أو رمادي.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2 id="أزل-التطبيقات-من-الشاشة-الرئيسية" class="anchored">3. أزل التطبيقات من الشاشة الرئيسية</h2>
<ul>
<li>على غرار بيئتنا المادية، فإن ما هو موجود على شاشتنا الرئيسية يصبح إشارات تحفز عاداتنا.</li>
<li>عندما تكون تطبيقات الوسائط الاجتماعية مرئية بشكل كبير على شاشتك الرئيسية، فمن المرجح أن تفتحها.</li>
<li>نوصي بنقل التطبيقات المشتتة للانتباه إلى “الخلف”.</li>
<li>يمكن لمستخدمي أيفون إزالة التطبيقات من الشاشة الرئيسية وتخزينها في مكتبة التطبيقات، بينما يمكن لمستخدمي أندرويد الاحتفاظ بالتطبيقات بالمثل في درج التطبيقات.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2 id="شغل-فلتر-التدرج-الرمادي" class="anchored">4. شغّل فلتر التدرج الرمادي</h2>
<ul>
<li>يمكن أن يؤدي تحويل هاتفك إلى التدرج الرمادي إلى جعل التمرير عبر الوسائط الاجتماعية أقل تشتيتًا على الفور.</li>
<li>لكنك لست مضطرًا لإبقائه قيد التشغيل طوال الوقت.</li>
<li>نحن نعلم مدى قوة هذه الأجهزة الصغيرة للعمل الإبداعي والترفيه.</li>
<li>ما نوصي به هو وجود طريقة بسيطة لتشغيل وإيقاف فلتر التدرج الرمادي، مثل إضافته إلى مركز التحكم على أجهزة iPhone.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2 id="خد-نفسك---أخر-فتح-التطبيقات" class="anchored">5. خد نفسك - أخّر فتح التطبيقات</h2>
<ul>
<li>لإضافة تأخير عند فتح التطبيقات، يمكنك استخدام تطبيق مثل: <a href="https://one-sec.app/">One Sec</a></li>
<li>يقدم التطبيق وقفة قصيرة في كل مرة تحاول فيها فتح الوسائط الاجتماعية أو التطبيقات الأخرى المحددة.</li>
<li>يعمل كحاجز شاشة مؤقت بينك وبين المشتتات، مما يساعدك على إمساك نفسك وتحديد ما إذا كنت مشتتًا أو متعمدًا.</li>
<li>يمكنك استخدام التطبيق على الموبايل أو على الحاسوب.</li>
</ul></li>

</div>
<ul>
<li><h2 id="احذف-التطبيقات-غير-الضرورية" class="anchored">6. احذف التطبيقات غير الضرورية</h2>
<ul>
<li>إذا كان التطبيق المشتت للانتباه لا يضيف أي قيمة حقيقية، فإن الحل الأبسط غالبًا ما يكون الأفضل.</li>
<li>احذفه من جهازك تمامًا.</li>
<li>ثم، استخدم وقتك الذي تم تحريره حديثًا في أنشطة مفيدة.</li>
<li>من التجارب المثيرة هي حذف تطبيق اليوتيوب من الموبايل واستخدامه من المتصفح، سيقلل هذا من الانغماس ويفضل حذف كلا من المتصفح واليوتيوب!!</li>
<li>يمكنك التخلص من تطبيق اليوتيوب بالكامل على نظام أندرويد بدون عمل روت باستخدام Adb manager.</li>
<li>وعندما تريد مشاهدة اليوتيوب أو باقي وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، يمكنك استخدام الحاسوب فهو أقل عرضة للتشتت والاستخدام في أوقات مثل قبل النوم أو في أثناء المرحاض أو تناول الطعام في المطبخ مثلاً!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><h2 id="أعد-تشكيل-عالمك-كما-تريد" class="anchored">7. أعد تشكيل عالمك كما تريد</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>إذا ما زلت تريد استخدام بعض التطبيقات، يمكنك التحكم في كيفية العرض وماذا تريد أن ترى وما لا تريد، والتوقف عن التشتت مثلاً.</p></li>

<section id="what-i-aim-to-achieve" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-i-aim-to-achieve">What I Aim to Achieve</h2>
<p>As a graduate with a Computer Science degree, my time has been primarily dedicated to three core areas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Programming:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve worked extensively with Python, C++, JavaScript, and Rust.</li>
<li><strong>Mathematics:</strong>&nbsp;My studies have encompassed linear algebra, probability, calculus, and discrete mathematics.</li>
<li><strong>Core Computer Science:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve explored topics like databases, networking, and data structures &amp; algorithms.</li>
</ol>
<p>During my final year, I realized there were significant gaps in my understanding, despite the courses and books I’d engaged with. I often wish I could start over, but real life doesn’t have a “retry” button.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m involved in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>AI Research:</strong>&nbsp;My focus is on medical image preprocessing and natural language processing. I’m also keenly interested in areas like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federated Learning</li>
<li>Adversarial Neural Networks</li>
<li>Explainable AI (XAI)</li>
<li>Generative Art (specifically Stable Diffusion models, Flux, and ControlNet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Web Development:</strong>&nbsp;I primarily use FastHTML and Astrojs for side projects. I enjoy building things and getting paid for them, as I don’t currently have a formal AI job.</p></li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="the-centrality-of-math-in-ai-research" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-centrality-of-math-in-ai-research">The Centrality of Math in AI Research</h2>
<p>It’s true that in both engineering and research, you can be an excellent software engineer and earn a substantial income without deep mathematical knowledge, possibly more than many mathematicians. However, to be a&nbsp;good&nbsp;researcher, a strong mathematical foundation is crucial. By that, I don’t just mean a superficial understanding of numerous topics. You need a solid grasp of linear algebra and probability, both theoretically and practically. And by “practical,” I mean the ability to translate mathematical concepts into code.</p>
<p>Of course, other topics are relevant, depending on your specific field. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generative AI:</strong>&nbsp;You’ll often encounter differential equations and advanced probability and statistical models.</li>
</ul>
<p>After reading research papers, you begin to see recurring concepts like conditional probability, Bayes’ theorem, and matrix factorization. But you’ll also find complex, novel, or sometimes even older, techniques that are hard to grasp initially.</p>
<hr>
<p>In my limited time exploring research, I’ve observed that many papers lack significant contributions. Some seem to be primarily workarounds, comparisons of existing models, new data applied to established models, or minor observations. This isn’t inherently bad, but it’s not the kind of impact I’m aiming for. The researchers who are making substantial contributions are often very skilled in&nbsp;both&nbsp;math and coding. They create open-source projects, share their ideas, and actively contribute, like the authors of the Colbert papers in information retrieval. And these contributions are often enabled by math, such as PCA, LORA, and other optimization techniques.</p>
<p>While a strong coding background can certainly be beneficial for optimization and research, I strive for a deeper understanding and to reach a higher level of impact. After all, we only have one life.</p>
<p>I don’t consider myself a “bookworm,” but I genuinely love reading and can become engrossed in books on diverse subjects and levels. I recall reading around four books on linear algebra, completing all the exercises, and summarizing the content. In deep learning, I’ve tackled more than 30 books. For areas like networking, databases, and data structures, I’ve read at least three books on each. When new topics like federated learning, XAI, and adversarial networks emerge, I always read at least one book on each.</p>
<p>If you were to examine my profile, CV, GitHub, or even this blog, you’d probably find that I’m below average for a recent graduate! What’s the problem?</p>
<p>I believe the core issue is that while I’ve read extensively and sometimes coded along with the material, I haven’t committed to projects that demand more time and mental effort. I haven’t really allowed the knowledge to “grow.” For instance, I learned linear algebra theory and did the pen-and-paper exercises, but I didn’t experiment with coding it. And, I didn’t apply the concepts I studied to the fields that truly interested me. There’s also a gap between the libraries we use in deep learning and the underlying skills – they don’t always feel directly connected.</p>
<p>It’s unrealistic to understand every library at a micro-level. But it’s crucial to try and bridge the gap between your fundamental skills and the high-level APIs you use. For example, challenge yourself to implement PCA from scratch with NumPy on a Kaggle dataset. Try coding the matrix components of LORA with PyTorch. Take probability concepts and apply them to datasets you care about – for me, that might be datasets related to fitness or Arabic language processing. Build projects you love using these new tools, and consciously choose what skills to prioritize. For example, I might be okay with letting go of some discrete math knowledge, but not linear algebra.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-days-of-problem-solving" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-days-of-problem-solving">The Days of Problem Solving</h2>
<p>During my second year, I began exploring problem-solving but initially struggled with platforms like Codeforces. However, after two months of encouragement from friends, I decided to give it another shot.</p>
<p>I was using Edabit to practice Python problem-solving with easy problems and then moved to Codeforces without a solid grasp of C++. It took time and many hours struggling with error messages (I once learned a painful lesson that “” and ’’ are different in C++ unlike Python!).</p>
<p>After about two months of this, my skills in both thinking and implementation improved dramatically. I recall one of my earliest achievements was writing a 300-line C++ solution without relying on Google, and of course, LLMs weren’t around at that time. This feeling of self-sufficiency was incredibly rewarding. After four months, my problem-solving skills had improved considerably, and I had reached the next level. However, I then decided to shift my focus to web development to improve my financial situation, and I never went back. I also remember failing a technical interview in my third year because I struggled to solve linked list problems in Python, despite being able to do so in C++. I felt lost throughout my college years</p>
<p>But that feeling of deep understanding, of being able to solve problems independently, is amazing and builds confidence. It’s a virtuous cycle.</p>
</section>
<section id="things-i-remember" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="things-i-remember">Things I Remember</h2>
<p>I’m revisiting linear algebra and realized I’d forgotten how to calculate eigenvalues, though I understand their role. However, I haven’t forgotten how to calculate the determinant of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix. Why? Because I solved countless exercises with determinants, but with eigenvalues, I had primarily read the solutions or tried simple examples. When using PCA in code, it’s easy to rely on a library and not think about the underlying operations. While that’s okay to some degree, we should occasionally revisit how things work behind the scenes.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-mbzuai-exam-in-two-days" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-mbzuai-exam-in-two-days">The MBZUAI Exam in Two Days</h2>
<p>A friend told me about a scholarship at MBZUAI with a deadline in three days. Although I didn’t have the necessary English test scores, I applied anyway. They’ve scheduled an exam in 7 days from when I applied, and today was the first day I started preparing.</p>
<p>I completed the linear algebra and probability specializations on Coursera taught by Luis G. Serrano. While it was a good refresher, I dislike relearning the same concepts every year! The exam will cover probability, linear algebra, calculus, algorithms, trigonometry, optimization, and some NLP questions.</p>
<p>I honestly don’t remember much about trigonometry, and when I studied it before, it was in Arabic, not English, and the transition isn’t so simple. I also dislike cramming things for two days only to forget them immediately after – that feels like a waste of time.</p>
<p>Despite the odds, I’m determined to apply, even if the acceptance rate for the scholarship is only 5%. Working with the people at MBZUAI would be a great experience. If I’m not accepted, I’ll continue to focus on mastering math and keep moving forward.</p>

<p>when i have a stress and a lof of taskes i go to reading books I have final exams in the comming days, MBZUAI exam, research paper review comments needed to be corrected, open source problem i must finish this week, some websites and a lot of things. I start reading the first the page and the author was talking to me and the words touch my soul deeply for example some qoutes from the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22363984">book</a> I will write them in arabic and you can translate them with GPT.</p>
<p><strong>Translations of the Arabic Quotes (with slight interpretations for clarity):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>“ولكن ثمة عامل له في نفسي حفاوة خاصة ، عامل يفسر كثيرا من فشل الطموحات و الأحلام … هذا العامل بكل اختصار: هو أن الخطط فوق الصخور و الارجل مازالت ناعمة ما حفيت بعد…”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“But there is a factor that resonates deeply within me, a factor that explains much of the failure of ambitions and dreams… This factor, in short, is that the plans are laid on rocks, but our feet are still tender, not yet calloused.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This emphasizes the gap between grand plans and the lack of practical experience or the “hard knocks” that build resilience and skill.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“إذا كان المرء ينام حتي تجهرك أشعة الحمرة في عينية و يبسط خوان الطعام كلما اشتهي ، ويخصص الأوقات الطويلة للقهوة و الشاي و العصائر و الفطائر ، ولا يسمح لنفسه بأن تتنازل عن أي فرصة فسحة أو مسامرات مع أصحابة ، و لا يستطيع كبح جماح تصفح الإنترنت أن يسرق ساعاته ، اذا كان المرء كذلك .. وما زال يرجو ان تتحقق يوما ما خططه العلمية و الدعوية و الإصلاحية ، فمثل هذا الشخص قد استأصل عقله ، و زرع بدلا منه مصباح علاء الدين”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“If a person sleeps until the red rays of the sun glare in their eyes, lays out a feast whenever they desire, dedicates long periods to coffee, tea, juices, and pastries, never allows themselves to miss an opportunity for leisure or socializing with friends, and cannot restrain themselves from internet browsing stealing their hours—if a person is like this and still hopes that their scientific, religious, or reformist plans will one day be realized, then such a person has removed their mind and planted Aladdin’s lamp in its place.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This strongly condemns a life of indulgence and procrastination, suggesting that those who wish to achieve great things must sacrifice leisure and work diligently. They cannot expect to magically fulfill ambitions like Aladdin with his lamp.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“لا يستطاع العلم براحة الجسم”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“Knowledge cannot be attained with bodily comfort.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This is a concise statement emphasizing the necessity of effort and sacrifice in the pursuit of learning.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“الكمالات كلها لا تنال إلا بحظ من المشقة و لا يعبر إليها إلا علي جسر من التعب”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“All perfections are not achieved except through a portion of hardship, and they cannot be crossed except on a bridge of fatigue.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This highlights that excellence and mastery require sustained effort, difficulty, and resilience.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“تلمح فجر الأجر يهن ظلام التكليف”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“You perceive the dawn of reward makes the darkness of duty pale.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This suggests that the hope of reward and the meaningful impact of your work make the hard work and sacrifice worthwhile.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“بقدر ما تتعني تنال ما تتمني”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“To the extent that you exert yourself, to that extent you will achieve what you desire.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This is a direct statement of the relationship between effort and achievement.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“ولم تعطني الأيام نوما مسكنا ألذ به ، إلا بنوم مشرد”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“The days have not given me a comforting sleep more delicious than a scattered one.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This beautifully evokes the idea that true rest is often earned by hard work and might not always be the most comfortable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“و اذا كانت النفوس كبارا تعبت في مرادها الأجسام”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“If the souls are great, the bodies will toil in pursuit of their desires.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This highlights that ambitious goals require a commitment to hard work that will test the physical body.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“وكذلك يحذر من التنقل من كتاب الي كتاب من غير موجب فإنه علامة الضجر وعدم الفلاح”</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Translation:&nbsp;“Likewise, he warns against moving from book to book without a valid reason, for it is a sign of boredom and lack of success.”</li>
<li>Interpretation:&nbsp;This advises against haphazardly abandoning study materials, highlighting that deep learning comes from thorough exploration.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>“وإن من الحكمة أن من ابتدأ بعمل وارتاح له فليستمر عليه ، فمن بورك له في شئ فليلزمه ، وبعض الناس يبدأ الأعمال و لا يتممها ، فيمضي عليه الوقت سبهللا من غير فائدة فمثلا يقراء في هذا الكتاب او هذا الفن ، ثم يدعه من غير ان يكمله وينتقل الي غيره ، ثم الي اخر ، من غير تكميل الأول فيضيع عمله وينقضي عمره بلا فائدة ، وكذلك في الأعمال الاخري كل يوم له عمل وكل عمل له راي فيضيع الوقت عليه من غير فائدة”</strong> - Translation:&nbsp;“And it is wisdom that whoever begins a work and finds comfort in it should continue with it. For whoever is blessed in something should stick to it. And some people begin tasks and do not complete them, so their time passes in vain without benefit. For example, they read in this book or this discipline and then leave it without completing it and move on to another and then another without completing the first, so they waste their work and their lives pass without benefit. And likewise in other works, each day has a work and each work has its own approach, so they waste time on that without benefit.”</p></li>

<section id="imam-al-nawawi" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="imam-al-nawawi">Imam Al-Nawawi</h2>
<p>Al-Nawawi began his pursuit of knowledge relatively late, in the year 649 AH. He was, as he himself stated, 19 years old at that time. This was considered a late start compared to the custom of their time, where people would begin seeking knowledge before reaching puberty. As Al-Nawawi himself said, “When I was nineteen years old, my father brought me to Damascus in the year forty-nine, and I resided in the Rawahiyya School.”</p>
<p>Al-Nawawi, may God have mercy on him, passed away in the year 676 AH, at the age of 45. Scholars in their forties typically begin to produce their most refined and meticulously researched scholarly work. Thus, the Sheikh, may God have mercy on him, did not live long.</p>
<p>Well then… when did the Sheikh begin writing and authoring? The Sheikh himself stated that he spent six years in the pursuit of knowledge, and then began authoring, i.e., he began authoring at the age of 25.</p>
<p>Al-Nawawi also informed his student, Ibn al-Attar:</p>
<p>“He mentioned to me, may God have mercy on him, that he did not waste any time, night or day, except in a task of engaging with knowledge. Even while walking on the streets, he would engage in reviewing what he had memorized or studying. He remained engaged in acquiring knowledge in this manner for about six years, and then he began writing.”</p>
<p>This means that most of Al-Nawawi’s works that we circulate today were authored during his twenties and thirties!</p>
<p>Al-Isnawi explains: “This phenomenon with Sheikh Muhi al-Din al-Nawawi was quite common. It is that, when he became qualified to study and acquire knowledge, he saw that it was part of his striving towards good deeds to make what he acquired and understood into an authorship, from which the reader could benefit. Thus, he made his authoring a means of acquiring knowledge, and his acquiring knowledge a means of authoring. Without this, he would not have been able to produce the amount of authorship he did. He entered Damascus to study when he was eighteen years old, and died before he reached forty-six.”</p>
<p>Al-Isnawi’s point is that Al-Nawawi made his authoring a way to acquire and seek knowledge. He immediately put his seeking and acquiring of knowledge into the form of authorship, i.e., his notes during his pursuit of knowledge, he would convert them into a form of authorship, rather than allowing the notes of his youth to be wasted.</p>
<p>Was this a coincidence for Al-Nawawi, or was it a conscious behavior? Meaning, did Al-Nawawi keep in mind the benefit of authorship in educating the author himself? In fact, there is a statement of Al-Nawawi in his other book,&nbsp;Sharh al-Muhadhab, which reveals that his early attention to authorship was for the purposes of self-learning. In his introduction, where he explained the etiquette of a seeker of knowledge, Al-Nawawi stated:</p>
<p>“One should pay attention to ‘authoring’ when one is qualified for it, for through it one discovers the realities and subtleties of knowledge, and it becomes established in one’s mind. It forces one to engage in extensive searching, studying, investigating, and reviewing, and to become acquainted with the different opinions of the Imams, their agreements, what is clear, what is ambiguous, what is authentic, what is weak, what is eloquent, what is feeble, what is not subject to objection, and what is. Through this, a researcher takes on the qualities of a&nbsp;mujtahid&nbsp;(one who can exercise independent legal reasoning).”</p>
<p>Here, Al-Nawawi is not just encouraging authoring, but he is revealing the motivations that drive authoring and expands on the effect it has on the advancement of the student’s understanding by obliging them to delve deeply.</p>
<p>Also, Al-Khatib Al-Baghdadi said: “Whoever wants to benefit, let them break the pen of copying and take up the pen of research.”</p>
<hr>
<p>And I’ve noticed that a lot of prominent figures in Deep Learning (DL) are doing this. For example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Michael Lanham</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2Fauthor%2FB07BPS6WQL">https://www.amazon.com/stores/author/B07BPS6WQL</a>): The author of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Evolutionary Deep Learning</li>
<li>Practical AI on the Google Platform</li>
<li>Learn Python Game Development with ChatGPT</li>
<li>and many other books.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Christoph Molnar</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fchristophm.github.io%2Finterpretable-ml-book%2F">https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/</a>): The author of&nbsp;Interpretable Machine Learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Christopher M. Bishop</strong>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fstores%2FChristopher-M.-Bishop%2Fauthor%2FB001IGLMNY%3Fref%3Dap_rdr%26isDramIntegrated%3Dtrue%26shoppingPortalEnabled%3Dtrue%23">https://www.amazon.com/stores/Christopher-M.-Bishop/author/B001IGLMNY?ref=ap_rdr&amp;isDramIntegrated=true&amp;shoppingPortalEnabled=true#</a>): The author of the famous book,&nbsp;Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning. He once mentioned that he wrote this book to ensure his own understanding of these concepts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>… and the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>My Approach: Building, Not Just Reading</strong></p>
<p>I don’t necessarily aspire to write a book, but rather to&nbsp;recreate&nbsp;knowledge from the sources I’ve studied (books, courses, and papers). I don’t advocate for simply “writing a book” as a goal. Instead, I aim to create accessible pieces of knowledge that I can iterate on and use to help others understand these concepts.</p>
<p>This is my intended approach, and I will start with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>“Building DL from Scratch” Series:</strong>&nbsp;Based on the fastai course and the&nbsp;Deep Learning from Scratch&nbsp;book.</li>
<li><strong>“Math Level Up for DL”:</strong>&nbsp;Based on multiple books, courses, and some experiments I want to conduct.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, I will expand on these approaches in blog posts and other materials on topics like federated learning and other areas I’m interested in. I’ll try my best to do all of this effectively.</p>
</section>
<section id="not-just-the-math" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="not-just-the-math">NOT Just the Math</h2>
<p>This approach isn’t limited to math. It extends to every skill, including CSS, Deep Learning implementation with pure PyTorch code, and so on.</p>

  <title>What is Federated Learning</title>
  <link>https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/fl/what_is_federated_learning.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>You’re on a mission to create the purest, sweetest, and healthiest honey in the world. As a mad scientist, you want to improve your beehive’s efficiency and ensure no one can steal your secret recipe for magic honey.<br>
After researching how to set up your beehive system—how the bees should communicate, and where to collect nectar in a protected way to guard against wasps that want to steal your honey and harm your beehive—you discover that a Federated Beehive could meet all your needs. However, it adds complexity to your system and requires a new mindset.</p>
<section id="traditional-ml-systems-centralized" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="traditional-ml-systems-centralized">Traditional ML Systems (Centralized)</h2>
<p>In centralized systems, you collect flowers into your beehive and start processing them to create honey, which is not secure since people will know the type of flower on its way.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</div>
<p>In centralized systems, we aggregate data from multiple sources into a specific center where training occurs, consuming significant bandwidth and moving user data off their devices.</p>
</section>
<section id="federated-learning-decentralized" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="federated-learning-decentralized">Federated Learning (Decentralized)</h2>
<p>In FL, your bees visit different types of flowers to collect nectar and bring it back to your beehive in a fast and efficient way. The nectar is covered in a protective container to prevent the scent from attracting dark wasps and others in the world. While this approach is secure and efficient, it requires more overhead in managing bee communication globally, combining diverse nectar, and handling potential issues like poisoned nectar that could harm your entire honey supply.</p>

<section id="introduction-to-federated-learning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction-to-federated-learning">Introduction to Federated Learning</h2>
<p><strong>Definition:</strong> Federated Learning (FL) enables machine learning models on distributed data by moving the training to the data, instead of transferring data to the training center.</p>
<p>FL was first developed by Google in 2016 for their Gboard application, which uses a user’s typing history to suggest corrections and predict upcoming words while preserving user data privacy.</p>
<p>The idea is as follows: distribute our model across Android users’ applications, train their data locally on their phones, and then aggregate the knowledge each user has learned using aggregation algorithms like FedAvg to combine the updates into a single global model.</p>
<p>This process must be repeated for multiple rounds to allow the model to learn from these small updates.</p>
</section>
<section id="honey-with-multiple-flavors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="honey-with-multiple-flavors">Honey with Multiple Flavors</h2>
<p>We decided to offer honey jars with multiple flavors based on the flower types from which nectar was collected. We’ll create a base flavor that everyone recognizes, plus special flavors with unique ingredients—some containing vitamin C, others a dose of caffeine.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<figcaption>Personalization in Federated Learning</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>In FL, this is called <strong>personalization</strong>. It can be seen as fine-tuning our global model (the base taste) with local data (special flowers) to meet specific needs.<br>
Since these unique flavors are likely to appeal only to certain local customers, they won’t be as popular with all customers compared to the base taste.</p>
<p>Our personalized model will excel on local data but may underperform on general data due to increased bias from fine-tuning.</p>
<p>An FL system allows us to manage the trade-off between user-specific preferences and generalization.</p>
</section>
<section id="horizontal-and-vertical-fl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="horizontal-and-vertical-fl">Horizontal and Vertical FL</h2>
<p>There are two types of FL: Horizontal (homogeneous) FL and Vertical (heterogeneous) FL.</p>
<section id="horizontal-federated-learning" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="horizontal-federated-learning">Horizontal Federated Learning</h3>
<p>Imagine our bees extracting nectar from the same type of flower in different places and in various quantities.</p>
<p>An example of horizontal FL is the Gboard application, where local training on phones uses identical data formats with unique content reflecting the user’s typing history.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-fl-instead-of-centralized-machine-learning">Why FL instead of Centralized Machine Learning?</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Centralized Learning</strong> lacks security, making FL essential for industries like banking and healthcare.</li>
<li><strong>Private data</strong> availability surpasses public data, offering more insights and patterns to uncover new abilities.</li>
<li><strong>User preference:</strong> Some users expect that no data will leave their device. For example, entering passwords or credit card information should not send those details to a keyboard app’s server. This use case led to FL’s development.</li>
<li><strong>Regulations:</strong> Various data privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.) protect sensitive data from being transferred. Regulations may even prohibit organizations from merging their users’ data across different countries.</li>
<li><strong>Reduced Compute Costs:</strong> Centralized ML with large datasets demands high computational resources, limited by individual machine performance.</li>
<li><strong>Faster Training:</strong> With FL, models can train immediately after receiving data, providing users with faster, more responsive solutions.</li>

<p>Most LLMs are trained on publicly available web data, but there’s a need for diverse data across modalities (text, images, audio, video). LLM architectures are similar, but the data they are trained or fine-tuned on is crucial. FL can help by enabling training on:</p>

<li>Private data

<li>Phones</li>
<li>Emails</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Regulated data

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="can-a-web-developer-creat-a-google-ad">Can a web developer creat a google ad</h2>
<p>My cousin told me that he can’t create an ad for his work and he had a verified business profile, so i told him give you the website and i can do it in just few minutes. I opened google ads and created an account followed the instructions and added my visa then after one day the ad started to work.</p>
<p>Then i noticed that i want to change the ad to make it more advanced for mobile calls. I paused it and created a new one, then my account get suspended and the reason is because circumvengint systems policy! Okey, then what is the wrong? Submit an appeal and add the needed documents to get verfified and after 15 days there is no response and the account is still suspended, what about the money i give to the add and neither me or google is using it! It had fly with wind.</p>

<p>I toke my friend account, which is used for around 5 years on google ads and has spent a lot of money i create the ad with a different domain for the website and didn’t add the business profile and my identifiy is verified…etc my account get suspened immeditialy ? WTF!</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Dont’ add huge amount of money, add only 5$ with 5$ until everything is okey you can increase it abit for example 50$ per day.</li>
<li>Google Ads is a black box! What, why, when, how are irrelevant.: Go ahead and create a new account and do the advertiser verification before creating any campaign. You can try creating a new google ad account with same email ID first and same payment method. Google allows multiple ad accounts with single email. Yes I know they say that you cannot create new account but trust me they do not follow this. I have multiple stable accounts running under same email IDs which also have suspended accounts. Just get those ads live whatever it takes🥂 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googleads/comments/1fu5acv/suspended_account/">reddit answer</a></li>

<section id="why-revisit-ds-and-algorithms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-revisit-ds-and-algorithms">Why revisit DS and algorithms</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>I am a fresh graduate from AI college, i spent the last 4 years learning about both Computer science and AI.</p></li>
<li><p>I was learning some math, machine learning , Deep learning and a lot of programming with python and C++, spent some a lot of time learning web also for freelance jobs.</p></li>
<li><p>a lot of time i had multiple interviews while i was a student in the summer and all the time the questions was about linkedlist, and some medium leetcode question and a few of them was about frameworks like pytorch or pandas.</p></li>
<li><p>I faced a strange fact when i started to work on life projects or some advanced books…etc they require a strong problem solving skills that i don’t have!!</p></li>
<li><p>I am revisiting these topics and will try to get out from the juypter notebook and kaggle world in software engineer with python and focus more on open source projects.</p></li>
<li><p>I want to reazlie the time/memeory order of the data structures i am using in my projects</p></li>
<li><p>I have read the algorithm book v3 and spent 6 months on codeforces with c++ i remember these days where i could spent around 10 hours per day solving problems with myself before the AI assistants like GPT..etc i am missing the good feeling after every problem i manage to solve and i was able to write around 90 lines of code without research or AI help..etc.</p></li>
<li><p>I will start learning again about this topics and make them a daily habit to solve a problem per day: - <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-data-structures">[grokking_ds]</a> - it’s a new book about data structure in python and explained with the grokking style</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/python-ds-skills/">[DS with python]</a> - it’s a mostafa saad ibrhaim udemy course with python version with a lot of problems to solve</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://neetcode.io/roadmap">[neetcode]</a> - a roadmap to focus on some problems selected from neetcode</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codingchallenges.fyi/">[coding challenges]</a> - A SE problems to help you focus more on how to build projects not just problem solving which will help me to start doing some open source</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="times-i-needed-ds" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="times-i-needed-ds">times i needed DS</h3>
<pre><code>- multiple time when i was trying to building some solutions related to NLP or graph neural network i know that this problem must solved with Linkedlist and this needs a type of tree then i struggle to continue....
- Learning about some NLP Algorithms or the new searching and matching techniques most of the time they are math equations with some optimizations you can't fully understand unless your skills in problem solving
- research in DL needs a huge skills in problem solving and how to understand the following architectures then update or utilize them to your needs more in this in the future but i think the better you are in SE the better you are in ML.</code></pre>

<section id="buying-the-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="buying-the-huawei-gt4">Buying the Huawei GT4</h2>
<ul>
<li>I bought it from Amazon for 13,000 EGP. I opened it immediately, and it looked so nice; I was very happy with its design and feel.</li>
<li>I charged it with the wireless stand.</li>
<li>I wore it after an hour and took some time to download the Huawei Health app on my Realme6 mobile.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="feeling-pain" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="feeling-pain">Feeling pain</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wore it, and after three days, my hand started to hurt, causing some discomfort because I was sleeping with it on without removing it.</li>
<li>I wore it on my right hand for four days, then switched it to my left hand, and my body felt more comfortable with it.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="the-design-of-the-huawei-watch-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-design-of-the-huawei-watch-gt4">The Design of the Huawei watch gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The design is attractive, and many people who saw me wearing it didn’t notice that it was a smartwatch—they thought it was a classic watch.</li>
<li>Others said that it looks better than the repetitive and dull design of the Apple Watch.</li>
<li>It looks very premium.</li>
<li>The brightness in sunlight is impressive.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="sleeping-with-huawei-watch-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sleeping-with-huawei-watch-gt4">Sleeping with Huawei watch gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The accuracy of the sleep detector is almost perfect. Sometimes, when you leave the watch near you for 6 hours, it detects that you are sleeping, but this has only happened maybe three times this year.</li>
<li>The accuracy of detecting sleep cycles and the time for each is spot on, and the graph analysis and statistics on this watch are easy to understand, creative, and full of information.</li>
<li>Why can’t I set an alarm based on the sleep cycle, like in the <a href="https://www.sleepcycle.com/">Sleep Cycle app</a>? This feature would be a game-changer!</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="calories-calculations-with-huawei-health" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calories-calculations-with-huawei-health">Calories calculations with huawei health</h2>
<ul>
<li>You enter your information, like weight and height, and based on your vitals and activity, it detects the calories you burn every second. I like this estimation feature.</li>
<li>You can set a goal, for example, to go from 92 kg to 85 kg, but the problem is you need to calculate the calories and record it using the phone, not the watch. This is slow and inconvenient—I don’t like having to open my phone often. Most of the time, my meals are repetitive, and recording them on the Huawei Health app is boring, so I usually just do a quick add.</li>
<li>In the future, I hope they let us add a list of meals to the app so we can select them directly from the watch.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="activities-with-huawei-watch-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="activities-with-huawei-watch-gt4">Activities with Huawei Watch gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heart rate tracking is a little slow compared to real-time detection, and sometimes when you are running and want to check your speed and heart rate, it takes around 3 seconds—quite a long time if you’re in the middle of a run!</li>
<li>The auto-detection of activities may only start after 20 minutes of walking!</li>
<li>SpO2… and then what?</li>
<li>They claim there are more than 100 exercises to choose from, but do I really use all of these 100?</li>
<li>Let’s look at the ones that are useful to me:
<ul>
<li>Outdoor run</li>
<li>Elliptical</li>
<li><strong>Jump rope</strong>: My favorite! It’s accurate and very helpful.</li>
<li>Indoor run</li>
<li>Indoor walk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ones I don’t use:
<ul>
<li>Outdoor cycling</li>
<li>Indoor cycling</li>
<li>Pool swimming</li>
<li>Open-water swimming</li>
<li>Mountain hiking</li>
<li>Hiking</li>
<li>Trail running</li>
<li>Skiing</li>
<li>Snowboarding</li>
<li>Cross-country skiing</li>
<li>Triathlon</li>
<li>Rowing</li>
<li>Track running</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Are these really 100 exercises?</li>
<li>Where are the gym exercises like pull-ups, push-ups, squats, bench presses, etc.?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="syncing-with-huawei-health" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="syncing-with-huawei-health">Syncing with huawei health</h2>
<ul>
<li>You must use one main device. I have both a Huawei Health and a Huawei MatePad, but I have to log in on just one of them to sync the information. What if I want to use both? You can’t.</li>
<li>Syncing with Linux or from the web? No, you can’t do that either.</li>
<li>However, syncing is very fast.</li>
</ul>

<section id="messages-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="messages-with-huawei-gt4">Messages with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>I love the messaging feature. You can read messages in multiple languages without any problem and respond using preconfigured answers, but you can’t type on the watch.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="music-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="music-with-huawei-gt4">Music with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The music quality and sound are great, especially if you want to listen to tracks before sleeping.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="calls-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="calls-with-huawei-gt4">Calls with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Answering calls from the watch is really nice if you’re at home, but not so much if you’re outside on the street, for example.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="battery-with-huawei-gt4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="battery-with-huawei-gt4">Battery with huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The best thing about the watch is the battery life. I don’t worry about it at all. I charge it for 30 minutes per week, and even when I use the always-on display, the battery doesn’t drain much.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-broked-the-glass-of-the-huawei-gt4">I broked the glass of the huawei gt4</h2>
<ul>
<li>The watch broke on the first day of college, probably because I pressed my hand too hard on a marble surface or something similar at the university.</li>
<li>I immediately contacted customer service, and a representative answered—I can’t remember her name—but she was incredibly polite, understanding, and helpful. I spoke to her again shortly after, and she asked me for specific information about the watch to check if it was under warranty or not. She followed up with me two days later, then again a day after that, and again two days later until I managed to get the invoice from Amazon. She tried to solve the issue by recommending an exchange and even told me which day to go when there would be discounts on the products.</li>
<li>Honestly, it was the best customer service experience I’ve ever had. She was able to go beyond being just a robot to become someone who understands, values, and helps—a human experience that brings joy.</li>
<li>At the very least, I had to document and acknowledge that she is someone exceptional. I requested to give her a rating, and I did. I’m really happy about that.</li>
<li>But I haven’t fixed the watch yet because there are no spare parts available in Egypt.</li>

  <title>The curse of SEO</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<ul>
<li><strong>Definition:</strong> SEO is optimizing your website pages to appear in the top results of search engines like Google and Bing.
<ul>
<li>Why is this important? It makes you visible to more people who are interested in what you provide—products, services, news, etc.</li>
<li>Enough of the basics. I assume you already know what SEO is about. Now, let’s explore a darker side of being involved in SEO.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How to Track Your Changes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Since SEO revolves around ranking, how do you track your position?</li>
<li>There are multiple tools I enjoy using, such as:
<ul>
<li><strong>I love to manually search keywords and track their ranks myself! :)</strong>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Say hi to the overrated WordPress SEO plugin “Ranking Math SEO”</li>
<li>It claims to simplify content optimization with built-in suggestions based on widely-accepted practices.</li>
<li>I use Rankmath Pro on a website I manage, showing impressions, total keywords, average position, and clicks. GSC offers all this for free!</li>
<li>This post isn’t about Rankmath; that’s for another time. In short:

<ul>
<li><strong>Losing Backlinks</strong>
<ul>
<li>Spam backlinks (like Khamsat, Fiverr, and Upwork)—most are harmful.</li>
<li><a href="https://khamsat.com/marketing/backlinks-building/2836532-%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%83-%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%83-pbn-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%81%D8%B6%D9%84-%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7">PBN Network</a>
<ul>
<li>This service claims safe PBNs for backlinks from Web 2.0 blogs, profiles, social bookmarking, social likes/shares, etc. I tried it, and none appeared in GSC after 3 months; worse, my site’s rank dropped.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://khamsat.com/marketing/backlinks-building/2191705-%D8%AD%D8%B2%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%83%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%83-%D9%85%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%85%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9%D9%83-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AB%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA%D9%8A">Manually Added Backlinks</a>
<ul>
<li>This package offers 70 PR10 backlinks from foreign websites, 60 Arabic guest posts, and 10 EDU backlinks, etc.</li>
<li>It worked to some extent, but the impact was minimal. Four backlinks from specific places helped more than these services.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Other services are mostly spam backlinks; some guest posts might help, but aim for real backlinks spaced out from related sites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Losing Ranking</strong>
<ul>
<li>This month, a home services website I manage improved from 65th to 9th in rankings, then disappeared, and later ranked 40th, etc.</li>
<li>This cycle repeats—a page gains rank, then drops.</li>
<li>It’s stressful; don’t check daily. Weekly (or every 2-3 weeks) is less stressful and gives fairer results, focusing on what’s important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>What’s Going Wrong?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Watching page changes from these tools is like social media’s new “like” button!</li>
<li>My mind loves the green and red numbers.</li>
<li>Ultimately, most analyses aren’t critical. Whether 23rd or 80th, if not in the top 5, what’s the use? Daily checks yield nothing; reaching top 5 goes unnoticed until notifications and calls confirm it.</li>
<li>If SEO is your sole income source, it’s a tough job—even though it can make you a millionaire sometimes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>How to Recover</strong>
<ul>
<li>Here’s what helped me recover from this addiction:</li>
<li>Create barriers for easy access:
<ol type="1">
<li>Separate Google accounts/tabs into another browser profile. Using Brave or Bing makes this easy.</li>
<li>Remove bookmarked tabs for these tools and clear browsing history.</li>
<li>Use extensions to block these sites; Chrome Store has many offering motivational quotes.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Delete Chrome and YouTube from mobile using <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/34702/how-do-i-set-up-android-adb">ADB</a>.</li>
<li>Move tool emails to spam except weekly updates from Mangools and GSC.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><strong>Final Thoughts!</strong>
<ul>
<li><p>As a programmer, I initially thought a fast website and quality content were key in SEO. I later learned that choosing keywords and acquiring backlinks are crucial.</p></li>
<li><p>A nice Arabic book which will give you true information about SEO <a href="https://academy.hsoub.com/files/28-%D8%AF%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%83-%D8%A5%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-seo/">دليلك إلي تحسين محركات البحث</a></p></li>
<li><p>Feel free to DM on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdelkareem-elkhateb-989a68294/">Linkedin</a></p></li>

<p>أحد الممارسات التي أقوم بها في بعض الأحيان هي مراقبة مصادر الأفكار التي تأتيني والمحفزات لها وتتبع أثر تلك الأفكار علي أفعالي ومشاعري ، يعتبرها البعض تفكير زائد وأعتبرها أنا نعمة تنقذني أحيانا من الإستغراف في الكثير من المهام والإستيقاظ متاخرا نسبيا.</p>
<p>بدأت المشكلة في الظهور في السنة الأولي الجامعية في تلك البداية التي يحاول كل شخص أن يظهر مهاراته وقدراته ويثبت نفسه ويحاول إثارة إعجاب الأخرين وتنشاءة العلاقات مع أناس من كافة المحافظات ذلك الدخول المفاجئ والكثيف كان له أثر نفسي سئ.</p>
<p>مثل تغير الاهتمامات علي المستوي الشخص والمعرفي و الدخول في تلك العلاقات الكثيره بدأت الأهداف المركزية التي كنت أحلم بها و أفكاري ومبادئ بالتشتت والتأثر بجاذبية كل شخص تعرفت عليه وصار بيني وبينه علاقة زمالة بل وحتي مجرد رؤية صفحته علي وسائل التواصل كل هذا طبيعي و مفهوم.</p>
<p>بعد محاول مراقبة الوقت اليومي واين يتم استنافزه وأين تسنزف أفكاري و مخزون التركيز لدي وجدت أني أذهب لنشر بيت الشعر هذا وتليخص الكتاب ذاك لأنتظر رد فعل فلان وعلان و انغماسي في الردود علي منشوراتهم وتتبع أخبارهم و تضخم طفيليي الفضول عندي بشكل مبالغ فيه مما أصبح يسبب قلق وحيرة وتشتت ومقارانات و وضياع أعمار.</p>

<p>الإنبهار السريع باي شخص يتحدث عن شئ لا أعرفه مرت 6 شهور تقريبا وأنا متاثر ببعض الأشخاص الذين كنت أعتقد ان لديهم قدر من العلم والصدق والاشتراك في كورساتهم التي ستجعلني مبرمج لأحصل علي دخل بالدولار في نهاية الشهر القادم <strong>ذلك الشهر الذي أمتد 4 سنوات دراسية !!!</strong> شهر أسبوعه بمقدار عام!</p>
<p>لنرمز لتلك الفئة من المؤثرين بالرمز س وهو إختصار لكلمة سبوبة ينتشر هولاء الأشخاص في أماكن صيد المبتدائين يبيع لك هولاء الأشخاص الوعود البراقة كورس لتعلم السايبر سيكورتي في خلال 3 شهور أو تعلم دبلومة علم البيانات والذكاء الاصطناعي في شهرين تنبهر كثيرا بالكارزيما وطريقة الالقاء ونظافة المكان والمحتوي الذي يعد مبهر بالنسبة لك فلبس لديك أي آليات للحكم علي الشخص أو المحتوي فكل معرفتك في العلم هي تعال نجرب حصة عند أستاذ شكري</p>
<p>طالب لا حول له ولا قوة لا يعرف أي شئ في عقلة غير ملخص الدرس الذي يحفظة عن ظهر قلب ويذهب للامتحان ليسكب تلك الاسئلة الجاهزه في ورقة الامتحان الابله ليتفاجئ ذلك المسكين أن لا يوجد تعليم جامعي حقيقي وانها كانت كذبة العمر الضائع في كل تلك السنوات من الابتدائية وهو يسأل متي الراحة من هذا التلقين الفاشل وتكون الاجابة الكلاشكية هي أتعب الوقتي علشان تستريح بعدين بعدين امته!</p>

<p>سواء كانت نتيجة الثانوية مرضية و أرضيت والديك أم محزنة وأصابك اكتائب وامتلئت بالحزن فلا تبتأس فالقادم أسوء عليكما ومرحبا بك في عصر الكهنة الجامعية بعد مرات البحث العديدة وسماع الأراء هنا وهناك والكثير من الفيدوهات التي تذكر لك مميزات الجامعة الفلانية وأقسامها ونعيمها وتذكرك بالابتعاد عن الهندسة والجامعات التقليدية والذهاب الي كليات الجديدة مثل:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>كلية الملاحة والفضاء</li>
<li>كلية الثروة السمكية</li>
<li>والحبيبة الخبيثة كلية الذكاء الاصطناعي كلية المستقبل وصناعة الريموتات ومكن الخياطة</li>
<li>والكثير من الكليات الجديدة أو القسام ذات الأسماء البراقة “ليس عندي أي إعتراض عن أي كلية أو تخصص بل أتمني أن يكون عندي عمر لكل تخصص فشرف العلم كافي”</li>
</ol>
<p>لكن المشكلة في أنها مسرحية وسبوبة عامة وكل فرد مشارك فيها بداية من المدرسين والأهل و المهاطيل الجامعيين</p>
<p>ذلك المعبد الملئ بالالهة والكهنة والمحرمات والذي بمجرد دخولك لبوابة ذلك المعبد وتقديمك لأوراق الالتحاق فقد تمت عليك اللعنة الأبدية وكما دخلت جسد ممتلئ بالأمل أو حتي جسد ممتلئ بالحزن والندم فسرعا ما ستخرج جثة هامدة فاقدة الرغبة علي العيش بل تفقد في كثير من المرات إنسانتيك</p>

<p>بعدما قدرت علي النجاة ولحاق أي وسيلة مواصلات سواء من بيتك للجامعة أو للموقف العام او من موقف العام للجامعة هنيائا لك فقد استنفزت 20% من قدرتك علي الصمود</p>
<p>ستدخل هذا الصرح الهائل المبهر في بدايته وتتوجه الي المعبد الذي لعنت به الكثير من الخدم الأكبر منك يتنصلون للبحث عن الفتيات الساذجات لإشباع شهواتهم.</p>

<p>كان التفسير الوحيد لكل هذا العبث هو وجود خطة شر كبري من الفراعنة القدماء لتوليد أكبر قدر من الطاقة السلبية والإحباط في كل مكان يجتمع فيه البشر او كان يفترض ان يكون ولادة جديدة لأرواح متعبة.</p>
<p>يتم إستخدام تلك الطاقة وإمتصاصها فهي تعني لهم الخلود فتلك المنطقة حلت عليها لعنة لا يمكن حلها إلا بالقضاء علي الفراعنة و إعادة الارواح التي أغتصبت والأحلام المفقودة أحلام البسطاء وللحديث هنا بقية في مكان وزمان أخري.</p>

<p><a href="https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B0%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A9">الجاذبية</a> (من فعل جَذَبَ) وتعرف أيضاً باسم الثَقالة (من فعل ثَقُلَ) هي ظاهرة طبيعية يتم بواسطتها تحريك وانجذاب كل الأشياء من الكتلة أو الطاقة -بما في ذلك الكواكب والنجوم والمجرات وحتى الضوء- نحو بعضها البعض.</p>
<p>على الأرض، تعطي الجاذبية ثقلاً للأجسام المادية (الوزن)، وجاذبية القمر تسبب المد والجزر في المحيط. تسبب الانجذاب الجاذبي للمادة الغازية الأصلية الموجودة في الكون في البدء في الاندماج النووي، وتكوين النجوم -وتجميع النجوم معًا في مجرات- لذا فإن الجاذبية مسؤولة عن العديد من الهياكل الواسعة النطاق في الكون.</p>
<p>على الرغم من ذلك فإن آثار الجاذبية تصبح أضعف بشكل متزايد على الأشياء البعيدة.</p>
</section>
<section id="جاذبية-الأشياء" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="جاذبية-الأشياء">جاذبية الأشياء</h2>
<p>هل يمكنك أن تفكر كثيرا في كافة الأشياء التي تجذبك لها من حولك علي مستوي الوقت و الأفكار والمشاعر وقوة الإرادة!</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>تاثير أصدقائك عليك</li>
<li>مكان سكنك</li>
<li>أسرتك</li>
<li>وسائل التواصل</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>التركيز</strong> ليس هو قضاء أكثر وقت في أمر ما لكنه قدرتك علي إبعاد المشتات عن تلك المهمة والقدرة علي التركيز الكامل فيها. فمثلا: فمثلا التركيز هو ان تذاكر 4 ساعات برمجة فقط وليس ان تركز علي ساعتين برمجة ويب وساعة ماركتنيج وساعة مذاكرة للجامعة ومحاول التنقل بينهم علي= مدار اليوم او كما احب ان اقول علي مدار نوم!</p>
<hr>
<p>ليست القضية كم لدي من الوقت لأعمل كذا بل كم من هذا الوقت لدي القدرة علي عمل هذا فوجود 10 ساعات فراغ ليس معناه انك تستطيع إستخدامهم جميعا بل يوجد منهم مثلا 4 ساعات فقط وهذه رحلة طويلة وتحتاج لتنظيم عالي ومحاول وخطاء والكثير من النصائح ليس هذا وقت ذكرها.</p>
<p>فلهذا ينصح بالابتعاد عن وسائل التواصل و تدفق المعلومات التي تشغل عقلك وقلبك في بداية اليوم فبعد ساعتين تشعر بالصداع والرغبة علي النوم وكأن عقلك توقف عن العمل.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="حديث-تخرج">حديث تخرج</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/life_style/images/chocies.png" class="img-fluid" alt="target"> مدي علي تخرجي من الجامعة بتقدير جيد جدا +B مترفع بضعة أيام تتملكني فرحة عارمة أنني قدت هربت من هذه السجون التي وضعت عليا طوالة هذه الأعوام شعور مريح جدا تبقي سجن الخدمة العسكرية اللهم إني أسالك الإعفاء من هذه التجربة ومن شرها وشر من فيها.</p>
<p>حديث تخرج في مدار جاذبية الأشياء السؤال الذي لم يتم تحديده بالكامل هو فيما سوف أتخصص الآن أفكر في إجابة منذ 3 سنوات وكل شهرين تزداد معرفتي وخبرتي وأجد أنني ليس لدي إجابة حقيقة حتي الآن. هناك 3 تخصصات أستطيع ان أبدا بها:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>مهندس برمجيات (ومن خلاله أختار فرع مثل برمجة الواجهات او الباك إند)</li>
<li>متخصص في علوم البيانات ( من خلاله أختار فرع مثل تعلم العميق والمجالات البحثية الشيقة الأخري)</li>
<li>الماركتينج + السيو + كتابة المحتوي (من خلال هو أقرب فرصة للحصول علي المال لسبب غير معلوم لن أصرح عنه) أين هي الصعوبة! الصعوبة تكمن في جاذبية كل فرع من تلك الفروع و أثر أختيار أحدهم عن الأخر من ناحية الأيجابيات والسلبيات لكلا منهما وليس هذا مكان النقاش ولكن ما أريد أن أشير له هو تأثير الإختيارات عليك و أثرها علي حياتك و وماهي أسباب ميولك الحقيقة لإختيار محدد.</li>
</ol>
<p>كيف سأختار الآن في الحقيقة قد أخرت ان أحجم جذب كل تخصص منهم لي في الفترة الحالية بالقدر الذي أرسمه لنفسي ومحاول الإلتزام بذلك والجمع بينهم للخروج بأفضل إستفادة ممكنة.</p>

<p>بعض الأمثلة التي أتذكرها و أجد فيها إستغراق أصحابها في كثير من الأوقات بغير قصد ونكران شديد لما يفعلون وهذا ما أخاف و أحاذر منه.</p>
<section id="الجيم" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="الجيم">الجيم</h3>
<p>في صباح اليوم دخل شخص أول مره أراه في الجيم يبدو متمرس في كمال الأجسام له نفسي عمري تقريبا يمشي مثل الحصان بشكل مريب تشعر كأن يريد أن يخبط في أي شئ أمامه ولديه إبتسامة عريضه طوال الوقت وعينيه تنظر لكل من حوله بشكل مريب وكأنه تقول هل تراني! أو هو كذا قرائها عقلي طوال الساعتين التي قضاهم بجانبي يصرخ بصوت عالي أعلي من روني كولمان بشكل مريب برغم أن الاثقال التي يتمرن بها قريبة جدا وأحيانا أقل من التي أتمرن بها و تعامله مع الأوزان غريب بحق يرفع البار الحديدي لأعلي ويسقطه علي الأرض بقوه ولديه هوس بالصراخ والتكسير حتي أن من يبعده دورين يستيطع سماعة ومن يسكن في الدور او يمشي في الشارع ونحن في الدور ال3 يستطيع سماعة بصوت واضح فياتري ماهو مصدر الجاذبية والمحرك لهذه الأفعال التي لم تستطيع كلماتي وصف الهمجية و الإزعاج المبتذل اليوم</p>
</section>
<section id="الجامعة" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="الجامعة">الجامعة</h3>
<p>يحضرني ذكر مثالين منتشرين طالب الإتحاد او الأنشطة الطالبية الكثيره</p>
<section id="إتحاد-الطلبة-والأنشطة-الطلابية" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="إتحاد-الطلبة-والأنشطة-الطلابية">إتحاد الطلبة والأنشطة الطلابية</h4>
<p>ذلك الطلاب صاحب البدلة الأنيقة والإبتسامة العريضة الذي يشغل نفسه في الإحتفالات والتنظيمات والممارسات الإجتماعية الكثير وتنظيم الندوات والكثير من هذا النفاق (أتحدث عن الواقع الجامعي لعام 2024) الأمر يشبه مسرحية سخيفة يصبح فيها هذا الطالب البائس يرقص علي هذا المسرح المزيف ويظن أنه بطل الفيلم وسوف ينتصر في النهاية ولكن كل المعتطيات تصرح بأنه مهرج بإمتياز ويخادع نفسه.</p>

<p>ذلك الزميل الذي تجدة يحاول بإستمرار أن يثبت لك أنه أذكي منك وأذكي من أي أحد في الغرفة وعلي بعد 100 كيلو متر من مركز وقوفه.</p>
<p>ذلك الزميل ينعمس في صوت الأيجو الذي بداخله فتجده ينعرف عن البوصلة الصحيحه لتحصيل العلم بشكل رأسي وأفقي بتوازن حقيقي ليصل الي مرحلة من إتقان العلم و الحصول علي وظيفة مريحة كم أشعر بالحزن عليه فلديه الكثير من الطاقة ولكنه يستغلها بشكل ربما يكون خاطئ و مؤكد أنه مزعج أيضا!</p>
<p>المؤسف انه بعد مرور بعد الوقت يبدا كل شخص منا في جمع معلومات في التخصص الذي يعجبه والإلتحاق بوظائف وصديقنا لا يزال في سراب أذكي شخص في العالم ومحاولاته المستمره بدون قصد لتبيان ذلك أصبحت مزعجة وأصبحت معرفته التي أكثرها أفقية مصدر إزعاج ونوع من أنواع التباهي المثير للشفقة والغضب أحيانا! يمكن التفكير في جاذبية الإيجو عليك وخداعك لنفسك في الحاليتن والتفصيل كثير وليس الغرض التعميم.</p>
<p><strong>مقترحات للخروج من هذا الفخ</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>راقب وقتك علي وسائل التواصل الأجتماعي وليس المقصد كم تجلس علي هذه المنصات ولكن أنظر الي تعلقياتك و منشوراتك ستجد أن أكثر شخص تتحدث عنه بشكل صريح أو خفي هو كم أنت عبقري وتفهم ما لايفهمه الأخرين! كم أنت ذكي! ستجدك متقوقع علي ذاتك!</p></li>
<li><p>الإنسحاب من مراقبة و أعين الناس و محاسبة النفس بشكل أكثر حزم و الأنسحاب هنا مقصود به وسائل التواصل و التجمعات التي تظهر فيه تلك الأفعال مثل مذاكرتك في نفس غرفة السكن الجامعي أمام أصدقائك و سؤالك المستمر للأخرين هل تعرف ماهي نظرية الهتوانا مطاطا ! و دعني أشرح لك كم صعوبة هذه النظرية وعبقريتها ..الخ</p></li>
<li><p>لا تترك إشارات للاخرين مثل الاهتمام الزائد بحالات الواتس والتيليجرام وإظهار المستمر لماذا تفعل مثل ديسكورد والأغاني التي تستمع لها</p></li>

<p>هوس الجمال تلك الفتاة التي كل إهتمامها هو جمالها والجمال والثروة والمال تجد أنه مهوسة بالجانب البصري عندها بشكل يجعلك تظنها ماكيت مخيف من الإنجذاب للماديات بشكل يطغي علي جمالها كأنثي يصل الأمر الي إلغاء الهالة المحيطة بها كأم أو زوجة أو فتاة عموما تشعر.</p>
<p>مشاهدة الإستغرام والتيك توك بشكل مكثف ومحاولة تقليد الترندات والمشاهير والإنغماس في أخبارهم… بعد مرور بعض الوقت تجد أنك امام فتاة لا تدري أي شئ عن كونها فتاة غير جسدها وجمالها حتي هذا يصل بشكل خاطئي.</p>

<p>المشكلة ليست في الأنجذاب لشئ فهذا مستحيل حدوثه لكن المشكلة هل أنا فعلا أسير في المدار الصحيح الذي يتفق مع الغاية الكبري بأفضل شكل ممكن وهل توجد محاولة التحسين المستمر أم أنك تتركها للظروف وتلعب دور المفعول به! هل فعلا بعد ذهاب العمر هل هذا هو ما كنت تود أنك أمضيت فيه عمرك! الخطر يكمن أن هذا كله يحدث من شد وجذب بدون أن تتدرك في أي فضاء صار قمرك.</p>

<p><strong>طعام الروح</strong> : كما أن الجسد له غذاءة فالجسد خلق من طين تجد أن روحك تثقل وتزداد جاذبية الدنيا وشهواتها لك و كذلك فروحك لها غذاء وهو الذكر فالذكر غذاء روحك كلما أكثرت منه ارتفعت روحك الي الأعلي وخفة جاذبية الأرض لك.</p>
<p><strong>الهدف الحقيقي</strong>: الهدف أن تدور في المدار الحقيقي والأمن ولا تغريك الممرات القصيرة السريعة التي تنحرف بك ييمين وييسار الهدف أن يكون سيرك الي المولي عزوجل وذلك لن يتم الإ بمعرفة ما يجذبك ويعبدك عن المسار وتجديد النية الدائم والتوجهة الي ربك. أحب ان اسميه إستعادة المركز وتعديل البوصلة و أكثر مكان أجد نفسه فيه هو إما في صلاة صادقة في جوف الليل مع دعاء مبتهل أو في صلاة جماعة مبكرة هادئة. في تلك الحظة تجد السكينة في قلبك وتهدئ كل العواصف. اللهم أعنا علي ذكرك وشكرك وطاعتك وحسن عبادتك.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-time-i-spend-with-kobo">The time I spend with kobo</h2>
<p>I spend on average 8 hours on my laptop “kobo” doing a lot of programming, machine learning experiments and browsing many taps.</p>
<p>I don’t use my phone a lot on average 1 or 2 hours, so i wake up and go to see my little friend and start journaling, wirte my ideas, perparing my todo list.</p>
<p>I have been using it for 4 years now, and it was a nice period i love that it hasn’t broken till now, everything is working good even the battery can stand for the 2.5 hours in the battery life with a lot of memory and cpu usage</p>
<p>You can easily say that my laptop is now a part of me i can’t live without it any more my dairy, movies, work and college is depending on it</p>

<section id="msi-with-linux" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="msi-with-linux">MSI with Linux</h3>
<p>After buying it, it wasn’t configured with Windows, but was another DOS version so I had to install a Windows version on it. After 1 week I get a lot of errors on it with the external monitor and the WiFi stops working or is not configured. I tried every Hindi video about this problem and gave it to specialists to try it, but in vain, the problem happened again and again.</p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> It was my first year at a computer science college, so the geeky thing was to use Linux. After some search, I installed Ubuntu and then tried a lot of distros like Void Linux, but the one that I picked and still use is the amazing PopOS! which is based on Ubuntu but better than it!<br>
The WiFi problem doesn’t appear again! And for Nvidia graphics, it’s solved in PopOS! which has a command to install some drivers. And everything works smoothly</p>
</section>
<section id="the-cost-of-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-cost-of-it">The Cost of It!</h3>
<p>I bought it for the cost of 20,000 EGP, which at the time I bought it was $X, but now 20,000 EGP is worth $XX due to problems in my country.</p>
<p>Its cost at that time is really high for my budget and family, but I insisted on buying it because I knew it would stay with me for years, so I wanted a good one.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-i-decided-to-buy-it" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-i-decided-to-buy-it">How I Decided to Buy It!</h3>
<p>The phrase “Machine learning needs an Nvidia GPU” was dancing in my mind, so my main focus was on a nice GPU card in a laptop with a low budget. After some search, I found that the best choices are MSI or Lenovo, but the Lenovo version cost about 4000 EGP more than the MSI.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>I tested the keyboard of the Lenovo, and every time I felt like I wanted to cut my fingers off</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It wasn’t available online, so I had to travel 3 hours to the store that sells it. It was a nice experience to buy something I wanted instead of a random gift from my father.</p>

<section id="i-am-not-a-gamer" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="i-am-not-a-gamer">I Am Not a Gamer!</h2>
<p>I didn’t use it for gaming because I am not a gamer, but I used it heavily in programming and some machine learning and basic computer vision models, and it works so nicely!</p>
</section>
<section id="kobo-for-ml" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kobo-for-ml">Kobo for ML</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/mteb_encoding/dragon_3.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Kobo"> Machine learning is a wide area, and you can use the GPU for 3 things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Train a model from scratch</li>
<li>Fine-tune a model</li>
<li>Evaluate a model (inference)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Train</strong> a model from scratch was an ideal task for such a GPU, but I was doing it for multiple computer vision classification tasks, learning new architectures, trying to build…etc. For ML you don’t always need a GPU but for deep learning, which is a subset of ML that uses more connected layers (which means more computing power and memory needs), you do.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-tune</strong> a model is the case I used the most - I download a trained model and try to make it work better on my data. What you need here is enough GPU RAM - in my case it’s a 6GB card. This worked fine with computer vision algorithms and classic NLP models with less than 1 billion parameters. There’s no chance to try the LLAMAS models on such a card!</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> a model means to just load the model and not fine-tune it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I was fine with all the ML tasks I tried to do, unless I opened the door to large language models like the GPT family (ChatGPT for example). These models require a lot of memory and need a good graphics card like an RTX 30 or 40 series to test, and there’s no chance to train these models on any RTX card!</p>
<section id="why-not-just-use-the-cloud" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-not-just-use-the-cloud">Why Not Just Use the Cloud!</h3>
<p>There are two main solutions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Kaggle
<ul>
<li>Kaggle has two GPU options, and I used it a lot, especially if the data was already hosted on Kaggle and was more than 10GB. Other than that, I downloaded a sample of the data and did my work on my own environment with CLI commands and VS Code configurations. This helped me a lot compared to just using the Kaggle editor, and it’s faster too! Sometimes the Kaggle kernel panics or just stops responding entirely!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Colab
<ul>
<li>Colab restarts after 4 hours and your work can get lost, and lots of annoying things like that happen a lot.</li>
<li>You have to pay for the GPU version. You get a number of hours to try it out, and it’s faster than my GTX 1660 by a good margin.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>But I didn’t love these cloud solutions, and I found having my own local setup to be faster and more comfortable.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="kobo-for-web-development" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="kobo-for-web-development">Kobo for Web Development</h2>
<p>I sometimes work on web projects (Django and JavaScript frameworks, especially AstroJS). I never had any issues building and testing web projects - everything worked nicely and efficiently.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-battery-life" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-battery-life">The Battery Life</h2>
<p>The battery life can keep it working for 2.5 hours when the power is out if you switch to battery saver mode. I don’t think it could last more than 1 hour in normal mode! This is the laptop’s biggest issue. Sometimes it powers off even when fully charged if you do a lot of computation without plugging it in.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-heat" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-heat">The Heat</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/mteb_encoding/dragon_4.png" class="img-fluid" alt="target"> I didn’t find heat to be a problem or even the fan noise in most of my work. But sometimes when running a deep learning model, the fan noise is a bit loud and it does get really hot. For normal coding and browsing though, there are no issues and the cooling system is fast. Overall I didn’t find heat to be a major problem.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-keyboard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h2>
<p>The keyboard is very responsive and well configured with smooth clicks - no issues or sticky keys even though I have fat fingers!</p>
<p>I’ve been using this machine for 4 years and I write a lot. No broken keys have happened despite my clumsy fingers. I have a mechanical keyboard that I sometimes use, but I always miss the feel of the built-in keyboard. The red backlight is decent.</p>
</section>
<section id="finally" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finally">Finally!</h2>
<p><img src="https://kareemai.com/blog/posts/mteb_encoding/draong_1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Kobo_finally"> I just wanted to say that I love “Kobo” and I’ve spent nice times with it - some really difficult and others really happy. It’s been a loyal friend and something to rely on.</p>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="issues-with-google-services-on-huawei" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="issues-with-google-services-on-huawei">Issues with Google Services on Huawei</h2>
<section id="stylus-apps" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stylus-apps">Stylus Apps</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Infinite Painter</strong> drawing app has broken stylus support and no pressure sensitivity</li>
<li><strong>NoteShelf</strong> note taking app can’t sync properly with cloud drives</li>
<li><strong>Nebo</strong> note taking app has subpar palm rejection and no Arabic language support</li>
<li><strong>Flexcil</strong> best ebook reader/annotator but lacks Google Drive integration</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="gbox-solution" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="gbox-solution">Gbox Solution</h3>
