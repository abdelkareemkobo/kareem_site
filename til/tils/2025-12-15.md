Imagine a blind trying to walk in a new city he didn't visit before and he didn't had a stick in this hand he just had an idiot rat who guides him with a rope, this rat sometime tell the man : 
Hey, Kareem can you wait some time I will go in batches to find the bus station. 
72  hours later you get hungry , lost your mind and your poor can't  get an Uber!
Then the rat come to you and said I didn't find a bus station, let's go and find a restaurant 72 hours later the rat is out of control and get panic from the long routes in this new city. 
You are hungry and the rat can't help he can just guide to a little places and in these little places you need to wait multiple hours to get a response from rat. 

This is my life being a GPU poor, I want to fine-tune an embedding model which is something trivial in the AI compute I will need to get GPU and based on the dataset size to fine-tune in my college it's a titan rtx it takes 72 so all my ideas and research will wait until the 72 finishes! 

The lack of immediate feedback is the bottleneck for ai if I was an engineer a frontend developer every change I made I see an immediate feedback on the screen, the flow continue until I had a good prototype in less than 2 hours and I can change ..etc this is what makes AI sicks! 
Any idea about anything to validate it you will spend months if you are GPU poor and doing ai research on kaggle or colap free instances is not good experience if you will use the free you are limited but the VRAM, time until they suspend the instance...etc this is not how AI programming should be. 
**I hope I can get an rtx 5090 in the next months**
